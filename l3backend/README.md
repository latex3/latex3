LaTeX3 Backend Drivers
======================

Release 2021-10-17

This package forms parts of `expl3`, and contains the code used to interface
with backends (drivers) across the `expl3` codebase. The functions here are
defined differently depending on the engine in use. As such, these are
distributed separately from `l3kernel` to allow this code to be updated
on an independent schedule.
