The \bezier command is now part of LaTeX thus this package is no
longer necessary.  It is only retained for upward compatibility.
Also, please note that LaTeX now offers an extended bezier command
which automatically calculates the number of points needed for the
plot.  See the 2nd edition of the LaTeX book, or the file
usrguide.tex which comes with the LaTeX distribution, for more
details.
