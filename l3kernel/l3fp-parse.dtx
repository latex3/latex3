% \subsection{Work plan}
%
% The task at hand is non-trivial, and some previous failed attempts
% show that the code leads to unreadable logs, so we had better get it
% (almost) right the first time.  Let us first describe our goal, then
% discuss the design precisely before writing any code.
%
% In this file at least, a \meta{floating point object} is a floating
% point number or tuple.  This can be extended to anything that starts
% with \cs{s_@@} or \cs{s_@@_\meta{type}} and ends with |;| with some
% internal structure that depends on the \meta{type}.
%
% \begin{macro}[EXP]{\@@_parse:n}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{@@_parse:n} \Arg{fpexpr}
%   \end{syntax}
%   Evaluates the \meta{floating point expression} and leaves the result
%   in the input stream as a floating point object.  This
%   function forms the basis of almost all public \pkg{l3fp} functions.
%   During evaluation, each token is fully \texttt{f}-expanded.
%
%   \cs{@@_parse_o:n} does the same but expands once after its result.
%   \begin{texnote}
%     Registers (integers, toks, etc.) are automatically unpacked,
%     without requiring a function such as \cs{int_use:N}.  Invalid
%     tokens remaining after \texttt{f}-expansion lead to
%     unrecoverable low-level \TeX{} errors.

%   Floating point expressions are composed of numbers, given in various
%   forms, infix operators, such as |+|, |**|, or~|,| (which joins two
%   numbers into a list), and prefix operators, such as the unary~|-|,
%   functions, or opening parentheses.  Here is a list of precedences
%   which control the order of evaluation (some distinctions are

% \subsubsection{Storing results}
%
% The main question in parsing expressions expandably is to decide where
% to put the intermediate results computed for various subexpressions.
%
% One option is to store the values at the start of the expression, and
% carry them together as the first argument of each macro.  However, we
% want to \texttt{f}-expand tokens one by one in the expression (as
% \cs{int_eval:n} does), and with this approach, expanding the next
% unread token forces us to jump with \cs{exp_after:wN} over every value
% computed earlier in the expression.  With this approach, the run-time
% grows at least quadratically in the length of the expression, if
% not as its cube (inserting the \cs{exp_after:wN} is tricky and slow).
%
% A second option is to place those values at the end of the expression.
% Then expanding the next unread token is straightforward, but this
% still hits a performance issue: for long expressions we would be
% reaching all the way to the end of the expression at every step of the
% calculation.  The run-time is again quadratic.
%
% A variation of the above attempts to place the intermediate results
% which appear when computing a parenthesized expression near the
% closing parenthesis.  This still lets us expand tokens as we go, and
% avoids performance problems as long as there are enough parentheses.
% However, it would be better to avoid requiring the closing
% parenthesis to be present as soon as the corresponding opening
% parenthesis is read: the closing parenthesis may still be hidden in a
% macro yet to be expanded.
%
% Hence, we need to go for some fine expansion control: the result is
% stored \emph{before} the start!
%
% Let us illustrate this idea in a simple model: adding positive
% integers which may be resulting from the expansion of macros, or may
% be values of registers.  Assume that one number, say, $12345$, has
% already been found, and that we want to parse the next number. The
% current status of the code may look as follows.
% \begin{syntax}
%   \cs{exp_after:wN} |\add:ww| \cs{int_value:w} 12345 \cs{exp_after:wN} ;
%   \cs{exp:w} |\operand:w| \meta{stuff}
% \end{syntax}
% One step of expansion expands \cs{exp_after:wN}, which triggers the
% primitive \cs{int_value:w}, which reads the five digits we have
% already found, |12345|.  This integer is unfinished, causing the
% second \cs{exp_after:wN} to expand, and to trigger the construction
% \cs{exp:w}, which expands |\operand:w|, defined to read
% what follows and make a number out of it, then leave \cs{exp_end:}, the
% number, and a semicolon in the input stream.  Once |\operand:w| is
% done expanding, we obtain essentially
% \begin{syntax}
%   \cs{exp_after:wN} |\add:ww| \cs{int_value:w} 12345 ;
%   \cs{exp:w} \cs{exp_end:} 333444 ;
% \end{syntax}
% where in fact \cs{exp_after:wN} has already been expanded,
% \cs{int_value:w} has already seen |12345|, and
% \cs{exp:w} is still looking for a number.  It finds
% \cs{exp_end:}, hence expands to nothing.  Now, \cs{int_value:w} sees
% the \texttt{;}, which cannot be part of a number.  The expansion
% stops, and we are left with
% \begin{syntax}
%   |\add:ww| 12345 ; 333444 ;
% \end{syntax}
% which can safely perform the addition by grabbing two arguments
% delimited by~|;|.
%
% If we were to continue parsing the expression, then the following
% number should also be cleaned up before the next use of a binary
% operation such as |\add:ww|.  Just like \cs{int_value:w} |12345|
% \cs{exp_after:wN}~|;| expanded what follows once, we need |\add:ww|
% to do the calculation, and in the process to expand the following
% once.  This is also true in our real application: all the functions of
% the form \cs[no-index]{@@_\ldots_o:ww} expand what follows once.  This comes at the
% cost of leaving tokens in the input stack, and we need to be
% careful not to waste this memory.  All of our discussion above is nice
% but simplistic, as operations should not simply be performed in the
% order they appear.
%
% \subsubsection{Precedence and infix operators}
%
% The various operators we will encounter have different precedences,
% which influence the order of calculations: $1+2\times 3 = 1+(2\times
% 3)$ because $\times$~has a higher precedence than~$+$.  The true
% analog of our macro |\operand:w| must thus take care of that.  When
% looking for an operand, it needs to perform calculations until
% reaching an operator which has lower precedence than the one which
% called |\operand:w|.  This means that |\operand:w| must know what the
% previous binary operator is, or rather, its precedence: we thus rename
% it |\operand:Nw|.  Let us describe as an example how we plan to do
% the calculation |41-2^3*4+5|.  More precisely we describe how to
% perform the first operation in this expression.  Here, we abuse
% notations: the first argument of |\operand:Nw| should be an integer
% constant (\cs{c_@@_prec_plus_int}, \ldots{}) equal to the precedence
% of the given operator, not directly the operator itself.
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item Clean up~|41| and find~|-|.  We call |\operand:Nw|~|-| to find
%     the second operand.
%   \item Clean up~|2| and find~|^|.
%   \item Compare the precedences of |-| and~|^|.  Since the latter is
%     higher, we need to compute the exponentiation.  For this, find the
%     second operand with a nested call to |\operand:Nw|~|^|.
%   \item Clean up~|3| and find~|*|.
%   \item Compare the precedences of |^| and~|*|.  Since the former is
%     higher, |\operand:Nw|~|^| has found the second operand of the
%     exponentiation, which is computed: $2^{3} = 8$.
%   \item We now have |41-8*4+5|, and |\operand:Nw|~|-| is still
%     looking for a second operand for the subtraction.  Is it~$8$?
%   \item Compare the precedences of |-| and~|*|.  Since the latter is
%     higher, we are not done with~$8$.  Call |\operand:Nw|~|*| to find
%     the second operand of the multiplication.
%   \item Clean up~|4|, and find~|+|.
%   \item Compare the precedences of |*| and~|+|.  Since the former is
%     higher, |\operand:Nw|~|*| has found the second operand of the
%     multiplication, which is computed: $8*4 = 32$.
%   \item We now have |41-32+5|, and |\operand:Nw|~|-| is still looking
%     for a second operand for the subtraction.  Is it~$32$?
%   \item Compare the precedences of |-| and~|+|.  Since they are equal,
%     |\operand:Nw|~|-| has found the second operand for the
%     subtraction, which is computed: $41-32=9$.
%   \item We now have |9+5|.
% \end{itemize}
% The procedure above stops short of performing all computations, but
% adding a surrounding call to |\operand:Nw| with a very low precedence
% ensures that all computations are performed before |\operand:Nw|
% is done.  Adding a trailing marker with the same very low precedence
% prevents the surrounding |\operand:Nw| from going beyond the marker.
%
% The pattern above to find an operand for a given operator, is to find
% one number and the next operator, then compare precedences to know if
% the next computation should be done.  If it should, then perform it
% after finding its second operand, and look at the next operator, then
% compare precedences to know if the next computation should be done.
% This continues until we find that the next computation should not be
% done.  Then, we stop.
%
% We are now ready to get a bit more technical and describe which of the
% \pkg{l3fp-parse} functions correspond to each step above.
%
% First, \cs{@@_parse_operand:Nw} is the |\operand:Nw| function above,
% with small modifications due to expansion issues discussed later.  We
% denote by \meta{precedence} the argument of \cs{@@_parse_operand:Nw},
% that is, the precedence of the binary operator whose operand we are
% trying to find.  The basic action is to read numbers from the input
% stream.  This is done by \cs{@@_parse_one:Nw}.  A first approximation
% of this function is that it reads one \meta{number}, performing no
% computation, and finds the following binary \meta{operator}.  Then it
% expands to
% \begin{quote}
%   \meta{number}\\
%   |  \__fp_parse_infix_|\meta{operator}|:N| \meta{precedence}
% \end{quote}
% expanding the \texttt{infix} auxiliary before leaving the above in the
% input stream.
%
% We now explain the \texttt{infix} auxiliaries.  We need some
% flexibility in how we treat the case of equal precedences: most often,
% the first operation encountered should be performed, such as |1-2-3|
% being computed as |(1-2)-3|, but |2^3^4| should be evaluated as
% |2^(3^4)| instead.  For this reason, and to support the equivalence
% between |**| and~|^| more easily, each binary operator is converted to
% a control sequence |\__fp_parse_infix_|\meta{operator}|:N| when it is
% encountered for the first time.  Instead of passing both precedences
% to a test function to do the comparison steps above, we pass the
% \meta{precedence} (of the earlier operator) to the \texttt{infix}
% auxiliary for the following \meta{operator}, to know whether to
% perform the computation of the \meta{operator}.  If it should not be
% performed, the \texttt{infix} auxiliary expands to
% \begin{syntax}
%   |@| \cs{use_none:n} |\__fp_parse_infix_|\meta{operator}|:N|
% \end{syntax}
% and otherwise it calls \cs{@@_parse_operand:Nw} with the precedence of
% the \meta{operator} to find its second operand \meta{number_2} and the
% next \meta{operator_2}, and expands to
% \begin{syntax}
%   |@| \cs{@@_parse_apply_binary:NwNwN}
%   ~~~~\meta{operator} \meta{number_2}
%   |@| |\__fp_parse_infix_|\meta{operator_2}|:N|
% \end{syntax}
% The \texttt{infix} function is responsible for comparing precedences,
% but cannot directly call the computation functions, because the first
% operand \meta{number} is before the \texttt{infix} function in the
% input stream.  This is why we stop the expansion here and give control
% to another function to close the loop.
%
% A definition of \cs{@@_parse_operand:Nw} \meta{precedence} with some
% of the expansion control removed is
% \begin{syntax}
%   \cs{exp_after:wN} \cs{@@_parse_continue:NwN}
%   \cs{exp_after:wN} \meta{precedence}
%   \cs{exp:w} \cs{exp_end_continue_f:w}
%   ~~\cs{@@_parse_one:Nw} \meta{precedence}
% \end{syntax}
% This expands \cs{@@_parse_one:Nw} \meta{precedence} completely, which
% finds a number, wraps the next \meta{operator} into an \texttt{infix}
% function, feeds this function the \meta{precedence}, and expands it,
% yielding either
% \begin{syntax}
%   \cs{@@_parse_continue:NwN} \meta{precedence}
%   \meta{number} |@|
%   \cs{use_none:n} |\__fp_parse_infix_|\meta{operator}|:N|
% \end{syntax}
% or
% \begin{syntax}
%   \cs{@@_parse_continue:NwN} \meta{precedence}
%   \meta{number} |@|
%   \cs{@@_parse_apply_binary:NwNwN}
%   ~~\meta{operator} \meta{number_2}
%   |@| |\__fp_parse_infix_|\meta{operator_2}|:N|
% \end{syntax}
% The definition of \cs{@@_parse_continue:NwN} is then very simple:
% \begin{syntax}
%   |\cs_new:Npn \__fp_parse_continue:NwN #1#2@#3 { #3 #1 #2 @ }|
% \end{syntax}
% In the first case, |#3|~is \cs{use_none:n}, yielding
% \begin{syntax}
%   \cs{use_none:n} \meta{precedence} \meta{number} |@|
%   |\__fp_parse_infix_|\meta{operator}|:N|
% \end{syntax}
% then \meta{number} |@| |\__fp_parse_infix_|\meta{operator}|:N|.  In
% the second case, |#3|~is \cs{@@_parse_apply_binary:NwNwN}, whose role
% is to compute \meta{number} \meta{operator} \meta{number_2} and to
% prepare for the next comparison of precedences: first we get
% \begin{syntax}
%   \cs{@@_parse_apply_binary:NwNwN}
%   ~~\meta{precedence} \meta{number} |@|
%   ~~\meta{operator} \meta{number_2}
%   |@| |\__fp_parse_infix_|\meta{operator_2}|:N|
% \end{syntax}
% then
% \begin{syntax}
%   \cs{exp_after:wN} \cs{@@_parse_continue:NwN}
%   \cs{exp_after:wN} \meta{precedence}
%   \cs{exp:w} \cs{exp_end_continue_f:w}
%   |\__fp_|\meta{operator}|_o:ww| \meta{number} \meta{number_2}
%   \cs{exp:w} \cs{exp_end_continue_f:w}
%   |\__fp_parse_infix_|\meta{operator_2}|:N| \meta{precedence}
% \end{syntax}
% where |\__fp_|\meta{operator}|_o:ww| computes \meta{number}
% \meta{operator} \meta{number_2} and expands after the result, thus
% triggers the comparison of the precedence of the \meta{operator_2} and
% the \meta{precedence}, continuing the loop.
%
% We have introduced the most important functions here, and the next few
% paragraphs we describe various subtleties.
%
% \subsubsection{Prefix operators, parentheses, and functions}
%
% Prefix operators (unary |-|, |+|,~|!|) and parentheses are taken care
% of by the same mechanism, and functions (\texttt{sin}, \texttt{exp},
% etc.) as well.  Finding the argument of the unary~|-|, for instance,
% is very similar to grabbing the second operand of a binary infix
% operator, with a subtle precedence explained below.  Once that operand
% is found, the operator can be applied to it (for the unary~|-|, this
% simply flips the sign).  A left parenthesis is just a prefix operator
% with a very low precedence equal to that of the closing parenthesis
% (which is treated as an infix operator, since it normally appears just
% after numbers), so that all computations are performed until the
% closing parenthesis.  The prefix operator associated to the left
% parenthesis does not alter its argument, but it removes the closing
% parenthesis (with some checks).
%
% Prefix operators are the reason why we only summarily described the
% function \cs{@@_parse_one:Nw} earlier.  This function is responsible
% for reading in the input stream the first possible \meta{number} and
% the next infix \meta{operator}.  If what follows \cs{@@_parse_one:Nw}
% \meta{precedence} is a prefix operator, then we must find the operand
% of this prefix operator through a nested call to
% \cs{@@_parse_operand:Nw} with the appropriate precedence, then apply
% the operator to the operand found to yield the result of
% \cs{@@_parse_one:Nw}.  So far, all is simple.
%
% The unary operators |+|, |-|,~|!| complicate things a little bit:
% |-3**2| should be $-(3^2)=-9$, and not $(-3)^2=9$.  This would easily
% be done by giving~|-| a lower precedence, equal to that of the infix
% |+| and~|-|.  Unfortunately, this fails in cases such as |3**-2*4|,
% yielding $3^{-2\times 4}$ instead of the correct $3^{-2}\times 4$.  A
% second attempt would be to call \cs{@@_parse_operand:Nw} with the
% \meta{precedence} of the previous operator, but |0>-2+3| is then
% parsed as |0>-(2+3)|: the addition is performed because it binds more
% tightly than the comparision which precedes~|-|.  The correct approach
% is for a unary~|-| to perform operations whose precedence is greater
% than both that of the previous operation, and that of the unary~|-|
% itself.  The unary~|-| is given a precedence higher than
% multiplication and division.  This does not lead to any surprising
% result, since $-(x/y) = (-x)/y$ and similarly for multiplication, and
% it reduces the number of nested calls to \cs{@@_parse_operand:Nw}.
%
% Functions are implemented as prefix operators with very high
% precedence, so that their argument is the first number that can
% possibly be built.
%
% Note that contrarily to the \texttt{infix} functions discussed
% earlier, the \texttt{prefix} functions do perform tests on the
% previous \meta{precedence} to decide whether to find an argument or
% not, since we know that we need a number, and must never stop there.
%
% \subsubsection{Numbers and reading tokens one by one}
%
% So far, we have glossed over one important point: what is a
% \enquote{number}?  A number is typically given in the form
% \meta{significand}|e|\meta{exponent}, where the \meta{significand} is
% any non-empty string composed of decimal digits and at most one
% decimal separator (a period), the exponent
% \enquote{\texttt{e}\meta{exponent}} is optional and is composed of an
% exponent mark~|e| followed by a possibly empty string of signs
% |+| or~|-| and a non-empty string of decimal digits.  The
% \meta{significand} can also be an integer, dimension, skip, or muskip
% variable, in which case dimensions are converted from points (or mu
% units) to floating points, and the \meta{exponent} can also be an
% integer variable.  Numbers can also be given as floating point
% variables, or as named constants such as |nan|, |inf| or~|pi|.  We may
% add more types in the future.
%
% When \cs{@@_parse_one:Nw} is looking for a \enquote{number}, here is
% what happens.
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item If the next token is a control sequence with the meaning of
%     \cs{scan_stop:}, it can be: \cs{s_@@}, in which case our job is
%     done, as what follows is an internal floating point number, or
%     \cs{s_@@_expr_mark}, in which case the expression has come to an early
%     end, as we are still looking for a number here, or something else,
%     in which case we consider the control sequence to be a bad
%     variable resulting from \texttt{c}-expansion.
%   \item If the next token is a control sequence with a different
%     meaning, we assume that it is a register, unpack it with
%     \cs{tex_the:D}, and use its value (in \texttt{pt} for dimensions
%     and skips, \texttt{mu} for muskips) as the \meta{significand} of a
%     number: we look for an exponent.
%   \item If the next token is a digit, we remove any leading zeros,
%     then read a significand larger than~$1$ if the next character is a
%     digit, read a significand smaller than~$1$ if the next character
%     is a period, or we have found a significand equal to~$0$
%     otherwise, and look for an exponent.
%   \item If the next token is a letter, we collect more letters until
%     the first non-letter: the resulting word may denote a function
%     such as |asin|, a constant such as |pi| or be unknown.  In the
%     first case, we call \cs{@@_parse_operand:Nw} to find the argument
%     of the function, then apply the function, before declaring that we
%     are done.  Otherwise, we are done, either with the value of the
%     constant, or with the value |nan| for unknown words.
%   \item If the next token is anything else, we check whether it is a
%     known prefix operator, in which case \cs{@@_parse_operand:Nw}
%     finds its operand.  If it is not known, then either a number is
%     missing (if the token is a known infix operator) or the token is
%     simply invalid in floating point expressions.
% \end{itemize}
% Once a number is found, \cs{@@_parse_one:Nw} also finds an infix
% operator.  This goes as follows.
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item If the next token is a control sequence, it could be the
%     special marker \cs{s_@@_expr_mark}, and
%     otherwise it is a case of juxtaposing numbers, such as
%     |2\c_zero_int|, with an implied multiplication.
%   \item If the next token is a letter, it is also a case of
%     juxtaposition, as letters cannot be proper infix operators.
%   \item Otherwise (including in the case of digits), if the token is a
%     known infix operator, the appropriate
%     |\__fp_infix_|\meta{operator}|:N| function is built, and if it
%     does not exist, we complain.  In particular, the juxtaposition
%     |\c_zero_int 2| is disallowed.
% \end{itemize}
%
% In the above, we need to test whether a character token~|#1| is a
% digit:
% \begin{verbatim}
% \if_int_compare:w 9 < 1 \token_to_str:N #1 \exp_stop_f:
%   is a digit
% \else:
%   not a digit
% \fi:
% \end{verbatim}
% To exclude |0|, replace |9| by |10|. The use of
% \cs{token_to_str:N} ensures that a digit with any catcode is detected.
% To test if a character token is a letter, we need to work with its
% character code, testing if |`#1| lies in $[65,90]$ (uppercase letters)
% or $[97,112]$ (lowercase letters)
% \begin{verbatim}
% \if_int_compare:w \__fp_int_eval:w
%     ( `#1 \if_int_compare:w `#1 > `Z - 32 \fi: ) / 26 = 3 \exp_stop_f:
%   is a letter
% \else:
%   not a letter
% \fi:
% \end{verbatim}
% At all steps, we try to accept all category codes: when |#1|~is kept
% to be used later, it is almost always converted to category code other
% through \cs{token_to_str:N}.  More precisely, catcodes $\{3, 6, 7, 8,
% 11, 12\}$ should work without trouble, but not $\{1, 2, 4, 10, 13\}$,
% and of course $\{0, 5, 9\}$ cannot become tokens.
%
% Floating point expressions should behave as much as possible like
% \eTeX{}-based integer expressions and dimension expressions.  In
% particular, \texttt{f}-expansion should be performed as the expression
% is read, token by token, forcing the expansion of protected macros,
% and ignoring spaces.  One advantage of expanding at every step is that
% restricted expandable functions can then be used in floating point
% expressions just as they can be in other kinds of expressions.
% Problematically, spaces stop \texttt{f}-expansion: for instance, the
% macro~|\X| below would not be expanded if we simply performed
% \texttt{f}-expansion.
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \DeclareDocumentCommand {\test} {m} { \fp_eval:n {#1} }
%   \ExplSyntaxOff
%   \test { 1 + \X }
% \end{verbatim}
% Of course, spaces typically do not appear in a code setting, but may very
% easily come in document-level input, from which some expressions may
% come.  To avoid this problem, at every step, we do essentially what
% \cs{use:f} would do: take an argument, put it back in the input
% stream, then \texttt{f}-expand it.  This is not a complete solution,
% since a macro's expansion could contain leading spaces which would stop
% the \texttt{f}-expansion before further macro calls are performed.
% However, in practice it should be enough: in particular, floating
% point numbers are correctly expanded to the underlying \cs{s_@@}
% \ldots{} structure.  The \texttt{f}-expansion is performed by
% \cs{@@_parse_expand:w}.

%     \@@_exp_after_?_f:nw
%   }
%   This function receives a \meta{precedence} and a control sequence
%   equal to \cs{scan_stop:} in meaning.  There are three cases.
%   \begin{itemize}
%     \item \cs{s_@@} starts a floating point number, and we call
%       \cs{@@_exp_after_f:nw}, which |f|-expands after the floating
%       point.
%     \item \cs{s_@@_expr_mark} is a premature end, we call
%       \cs{@@_exp_after_expr_mark_f:nw}, which triggers an |fp-early-end|
%       error.
%     \item For a control sequence not containing \cs[no-index]{s_@@}, we call
%       \cs{@@_exp_after_?_f:nw}, causing a |bad-variable| error.
%   \end{itemize}
%   This scheme is extensible: additional types can be added by starting
%   the variables with a scan mark of the form \cs[no-index]{s_@@_\meta{type}} and
%   defining |\__fp_exp_after_|\meta{type}|_f:nw|.  In all cases, we
%   make sure that the second argument of \cs{@@_parse_infix:NN} is
%   correctly expanded.
%   A special case only enabled in \LaTeXe{} is that if \tn{protect} is
%   encountered then the error message mentions the control sequence
%   which follows it rather than \tn{protect} itself.  The test for
%   \LaTeXe{} uses \tn{@unexpandable@protect} rather than \tn{protect}
%   because \tn{protect} is often \cs{scan_stop:} hence \enquote{does

% if the next character is a digit, start reading a significand $\geq 1$
% with the set of functions |\__fp_parse_large|\ldots{}; if it is a
% period, the significand is~$<1$; and otherwise it is zero.  In the
% second case, trim additional zeros after the period, counting them for
% an exponent shift $\meta{exp_1}<0$, then read the significand with the
% set of functions |\__fp_parse_small|\ldots{} Once the significand is
% read, read the exponent if |e|~is present.
%
% \begin{macro}[rEXP]{\@@_parse_trim_zeros:N, \@@_parse_trim_end:w}

%   is $\geq 1$); if it is |.|, then continue trimming zeros with

%   \cs{int_value:w} (which allows us to collect digits and continue

%   two steps of $8$ digits.  Since |#1| is a digit, read seven more
%   digits using \cs{@@_parse_digits_vii:N}.  The \texttt{small_leading}
%   auxiliary leaves those digits in the \cs{int_value:w}, and

% \subsubsection{Number: finding the exponent}
%
% Expansion is a little bit tricky here, in part because we accept input
% where multiplication is implicit.
% \begin{syntax}
%   \cs{@@_parse:n} |{ 3.2 erf(0.1) }|
%   \cs{@@_parse:n} |{ 3.2 e\l_my_int }|
%   \cs{@@_parse:n} |{ 3.2 \c_pi_fp }|
% \end{syntax}
% The first case indicates that just looking one character ahead for an
% \enquote{\texttt{e}} is not enough, since we would mistake the
% function \texttt{erf} for an exponent of \enquote{\texttt{rf}}.  An
% alternative would be to look two tokens ahead and check if what
% follows is a sign or a digit, considering in that case that we must be
% finding an exponent.  But taking care of the second case requires that
% we unpack registers after \texttt{e}.  However, blindly expanding the
% two tokens ahead completely would break the third example (unpacking
% is even worse).  Indeed, in the course of reading $3.2$, \cs{c_pi_fp}
% is expanded to \cs{s_@@} \cs{@@_chk:w} |1| |0| |{-1}| |{3141}|
% $\cdots$ |;| and \cs{s_@@} stops the expansion.  Expanding two tokens
% ahead would then force the expansion of \cs{@@_chk:w} (despite it
% being protected), and that function tries to produce an error.
%
% What can we do?  Really, the reason why this last case breaks is that
% just as \TeX{} does, we should read ahead as little as possible.
% Here, the only case where there may be an exponent is if the first
% token ahead is |e|.  Then we expand (and possibly unpack) the second
% token.
