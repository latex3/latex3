\maketitle

This file describes aspects of \TeX{} programming that are relevant in a
\LaTeX3 context.

\section{Reading a file}

Tokenization.

Treatment of spaces, such as the trap that \verb|\~~a| is equivalent to
\verb|\~a| in expl syntax, or that \verb|~| fails to give a space at the
beginning of a line.

\section{Structure of tokens}

Copy there the section ``Description of all possible tokens'' from \texttt{l3token}.

\section{Quantities and expressions}

Integer denotations, dimensions, glue (including \texttt{fill} and \texttt{true pt} and the like).

Syntax of integer expressions (including the trap that \verb|-(1+2)| is invalid).

\section{\LaTeX3 terms}

Terms like ``intexpr'' or ``seq var'' used in syntax blocks.
