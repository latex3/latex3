% This document typesets the LaTeX3 sources as a single document.
% This produces quite a large file (more than 1670 pages as of Dec 2023).
%
% There is also a shorter version (interface3.tex) that only typesets the
% command % interface descriptions.
%
% Do not forget to generate the index (as explained on the terminal output
% near the end of the run)!
