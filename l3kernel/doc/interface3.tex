% This document typesets the LaTeX3 interface descriptions a single document.
% This produces quite a large file (more than 170 pages currently).
%
% There is also a full version of the sources (source3.tex) which additionally
% also typesets the command implementations.
%
% Do not forget to generate the index (as explained on the terminal output
% near the end of the run)!
