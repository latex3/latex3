% \section{Important notice}
%
% This module provides a space in which functions can be added to
% \pkg{l3kernel} (\pkg{expl3}) while still being experimental.
% \begin{quote}
%  \bfseries
% As such, the
% functions here may not remain in their current form, or indeed at all,
% in \pkg{l3kernel} in the future.
% \end{quote}
%  In contrast to the material in
% \pkg{l3experimental}, the functions here are all \emph{small} additions to
% the kernel. We encourage programmers to test them out and report back on
% the \texttt{LaTeX-L} mailing list.
%
% \medskip
%
%   Thus, if you intend to use any of these functions from the candidate module in a public package
%  offered to others for productive use (e.g., being placed on CTAN) please consider the following points carefully:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Be prepared that your public packages might require updating when such functions
%        are being finalized.
% \item Consider informing us that you use a particular function in your public package, e.g., by
%         discussing this on the \texttt{LaTeX-L}
%    mailing list. This way it becomes easier to coordinate any updates necessary without issues
%    for the users of your package.
% \item Discussing and understanding use cases for a particular addition or concept also helps to
%         ensure that we provide the right interfaces in the final version so please give us feedback
%         if you consider a certain candidate function useful (or not).
% \end{itemize}
% We only add functions in this space if we consider them being serious candidates for a final inclusion
% into the kernel. However, real use sometimes leads to better ideas, so functions from this module are
% \textbf{not necessarily stable} and we may have to adjust them!
