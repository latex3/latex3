\maketitle

This file lists functions whose syntax has changed after August 2011,
with an approximate date.

\section{August 2011}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \cs{tl_if_single:n\TF} recognized any non-zero number of
    explicit spaces as \meta{true}, and did not ignore trailing spaces.
    Now it is \meta{true} for
    \[
      \meta{optional spaces}
      \meta{normal token or brace group}
      \meta{optional spaces}.
    \]
  \item \cs{tl_reverse:n} stripped outer braces and lost unprotected spaces.
    Now it keeps spaces, leaves unbraced single tokens unbraced, and
    braced groups braced.
  \item \cs{tl_trim_spaces:n} only removed one leading and trailing space.
    Now removes recursively. Also, on the left it used to strip implicit
    and explicit spaces with any character code. Now it strips only explicit
    space characters $(32,10)$.
\end{itemize}

\section{September 2011}

\begin{itemize}
\item clist functions which receive an \texttt{n}-type comma list argument
  now trim spaces from each item in the argument.
\end{itemize}
