%
% The \pkg{l3regex} package provides regular expression testing,
% extraction of submatches, splitting, and replacement, all acting
% on token lists. The syntax of regular expressions is mostly a subset
% of the \textsc{pcre} syntax (and very close to \textsc{posix}),
% with some additions
% due to the fact that \TeX{} manipulates tokens rather than characters.
% For performance reasons, only a limited set of features are implemented.
% Notably, back-references are not supported.
%
% Let us give a few examples. After
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \tl_set:Nn \l_my_tl { That~cat. }
%   \regex_replace_once:nnN { at } { is } \l_my_tl
% \end{verbatim}
% the token list variable \cs[no-index]{l_my_tl} holds the text
% \enquote{\texttt{This cat.}}, where the first
% occurrence of \enquote{\texttt{at}} was replaced
% by \enquote{\texttt{is}}. A more complicated example is
% a pattern to emphasize each word and add a comma after it:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \regex_replace_all:nnN { \w+ } { \c{emph}\cB\{ \0 \cE\} , } \l_my_tl
% \end{verbatim}
% The |\w| sequence represents any \enquote{word} character, and |+|
% indicates that the |\w| sequence should be repeated as many times as
% possible (at least once), hence matching a word in the input token
% list. In the replacement text, |\0| denotes the full match (here, a
% word).  The command |\emph| is inserted using |\c{emph}|, and its
% argument |\0| is put between braces |\cB\{| and |\cE\}|.
%
% If a regular expression is to be used several times,
% it can be compiled once, and stored in a regex
% variable using \cs{regex_set:Nn}. For example,
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \regex_new:N \l_foo_regex
%   \regex_set:Nn \l_foo_regex { \c{begin} \cB. (\c[^BE].*) \cE. }
% \end{verbatim}
% stores in \cs[no-index]{l_foo_regex} a regular expression which matches the
% starting marker for an environment: \cs[no-index]{begin}, followed by a
% begin-group token (|\cB.|), then any number of tokens which are
% neither begin-group nor end-group character tokens (|\c[^BE].*|),
% ending with an end-group token (|\cE.|). As explained in the next
% section, the parentheses \enquote{capture} the result of |\c[^BE].*|,
% giving us access to the name of the environment when doing
% replacements.
%
% \section{Syntax of regular expressions}
%
% \subsection{Regular expression examples}
%
% We start with a few examples, and encourage the reader to apply
% \cs{regex_show:n} to these regular expressions.
% \begin{itemize}
% \item |Cat| matches the word \enquote{Cat} capitalized in this way,
%   but also matches the beginning of the word \enquote{Cattle}: use
%   |\bCat\b| to match a complete word only.
% \item |[abc]| matches one letter among \enquote{a}, \enquote{b},
%   \enquote{c}; the pattern \verb"(a|b|c)" matches the same three
%   possible letters (but see the discussion of submatches below).
% \item |[A-Za-z]*| matches any number (due to the quantifier
%   \verb"*") of Latin letters (not accented).
% \item |\c{[A-Za-z]*}| matches a control sequence made of Latin
%   letters.
% \item |\_[^\_]*\_| matches an underscore, any number of characters
%   other than underscore, and another underscore; it is equivalent to
%   |\_.*?\_| where |.| matches arbitrary characters and the
%   lazy quantifier |*?| means to match as few characters as
%   possible, thus avoiding matching underscores.
% \item |[\+\-]?\d+| matches an explicit integer with at most one
%   sign.
% \item \verb*"[\+\-\ ]*\d+\ *" matches an explicit integer with any
%   number of $+$ and $-$ signs, with spaces allowed except within the
%   mantissa, and surrounded by spaces.
% \item \verb*"[\+\-\ ]*(\d+|\d*\.\d+)\ *" matches an explicit integer or
%   decimal number; using \verb*"[.,]" instead of \verb*"\." would allow
%   the comma as a decimal marker.
% \item
%   \verb*"[\+\-\ ]*(\d+|\d*\.\d+)\ *((?i)pt|in|[cem]m|ex|[bs]p|[dn]d|[pcn]c)\ *"
%   \allowbreak matches an explicit dimension with any unit that \TeX{} knows, where
%   \verb*"(?i)" means to treat lowercase and uppercase letters
%   identically.
% \item \verb*"[\+\-\ ]*((?i)nan|inf|(\d+|\d*\.\d+)(\ *e[\+\-\ ]*\d+)?)\ *"
%   matches an explicit floating point number or the special values
%   \verb*"nan" and \verb*"inf" (with signs and spaces allowed).
% \item \verb*"[\+\-\ ]*(\d+|\cC.)\ *" matches an explicit integer or
%   control sequence (without checking whether it is an integer
%   variable).
% \item |\G.*?\K| at the beginning of a regular expression matches and
%   discards (due to |\K|) everything between the end of the previous
%   match (|\G|) and what is matched by the rest of the regular
%   expression; this is useful in \cs{regex_replace_all:nnN} when the
%   goal is to extract matches or submatches in a finer way than with
%   \cs{regex_extract_all:nnN}.
% \end{itemize}
% While it is impossible for a regular expression to match only integer
% expressions, \verb*"[\+\-\(]*\d+\)*([\+\-*/][\+\-\(]*\d+\)*)*" matches among
% other things all valid integer expressions (made only with explicit
% integers).  One should follow it with further testing.
%
% \subsection{Characters in regular expressions}
%
% Most characters match exactly themselves,
% with an arbitrary category code. Some characters are
% special and must be escaped with a backslash (\emph{e.g.}, |\*|
% matches a star character). Some escape sequences of
% the form backslash--letter also have a special meaning
% (for instance |\d| matches any digit). As a rule,
% \begin{itemize}
% \item every alphanumeric character (\texttt{A}--\texttt{Z},
%   \texttt{a}--\texttt{z}, \texttt{0}--\texttt{9}) matches
%   exactly itself, and should not be escaped, because
%   |\A|, |\B|, \ldots{} have special meanings;
% \item non-alphanumeric printable ascii characters can (and should)
%   always be escaped: many of them have special meanings (\emph{e.g.},
%   use |\(|, |\)|, |\?|, |\.|, |\^|);
% \item spaces should always be escaped (even in character
%   classes);
% \item any other character may be escaped or not, without any
%   effect: both versions match exactly that character.
% \end{itemize}
% Note that these rules play nicely with the fact that many
% non-alphanumeric characters are difficult to input into \TeX{}
% under normal category codes. For instance, |\\abc\%|
% matches the characters |\abc%| (with arbitrary category codes),
% but does not match the control sequence |\abc| followed by a
% percent character. Matching control sequences can be done
% using the |\c|\Arg{regex} syntax (see below).
%
% Any special character which appears at a place where its special
% behaviour cannot apply matches itself instead (for instance, a
% quantifier appearing at the beginning of a string), after raising a
% warning.
%
% Characters.
% \begin{l3regex-syntax}
%   \item[\\x\{hh\ldots{}\}] Character with hex code \texttt{hh\ldots{}}
%   \item[\\xhh] Character with hex code \texttt{hh}.
%   \item[\\a] Alarm (hex 07).
%   \item[\\e] Escape (hex 1B).
%   \item[\\f] Form-feed (hex 0C).
%   \item[\\n] New line (hex 0A).
%   \item[\\r] Carriage return (hex 0D).
%   \item[\\t] Horizontal tab (hex 09).
% \end{l3regex-syntax}
%
% \subsection{Characters classes}
%
% Character properties.
% \begin{l3regex-syntax}
%   \item[.] A single period matches any token.
%   \item[\\d] Any decimal digit.
%   \item[\\h] Any horizontal space character,
%     equivalent to |[\ \^^I]|: space and tab.
%   \item[\\s] Any space character,
%     equivalent to |[\ \^^I\^^J\^^L\^^M]|.
%   \item[\\v] Any vertical space character,
%     equivalent to |[\^^J\^^K\^^L\^^M]|. Note that |\^^K| is a vertical space,
%     but not a space, for compatibility with Perl.
%   \item[\\w] Any word character, \emph{i.e.},
%     alphanumerics and underscore, equivalent to the explicit
%     class |[A-Za-z0-9\_]|.
%   \item[\\D] Any token not matched by |\d|.
%   \item[\\H] Any token not matched by |\h|.
%   \item[\\N] Any token other than the |\n| character (hex 0A).
%   \item[\\S] Any token not matched by |\s|.
%   \item[\\V] Any token not matched by |\v|.
%   \item[\\W] Any token not matched by |\w|.
% \end{l3regex-syntax}
% Of those, |.|, |\D|, |\H|, |\N|, |\S|, |\V|, and |\W| match arbitrary
% control sequences.
%
% Character classes match exactly one token in the subject.
% \begin{l3regex-syntax}
%   \item[{[\ldots{}]}] Positive character class.
%     Matches any of the specified tokens.
%   \item[{[\char`\^\ldots{}]}] Negative character class.
%     Matches any token other than the specified characters.
%   \item[{x-y}] Within a character class, this denotes a range (can be
%     used with escaped characters).
%   \item[{[:\meta{name}:]}] Within a character class (one more set of
%     brackets), this denotes the \textsc{posix} character class
%     \meta{name}, which can be \texttt{alnum}, \texttt{alpha},
%     \texttt{ascii}, \texttt{blank}, \texttt{cntrl}, \texttt{digit},
%     \texttt{graph}, \texttt{lower}, \texttt{print}, \texttt{punct},
%     \texttt{space}, \texttt{upper}, \texttt{word}, or \texttt{xdigit}.
%   \item[{[:\char`\^\meta{name}:]}] Negative \textsc{posix} character class.
% \end{l3regex-syntax}
% For instance, |[a-oq-z\cC.]| matches any lowercase latin letter
% except |p|, as well as control sequences (see below for a description
% of |\c|).
%
% In character classes, only |[|, |^|, |-|, |]|, |\| and spaces are
% special, and should be escaped. Other non-alphanumeric characters can
% still be escaped without harm. Any escape sequence which matches a
% single character (|\d|, |\D|, \emph{etc.}) is supported in character
% classes.  If the first character is |^|, then
% the meaning of the character class is inverted; |^| appearing anywhere
% else in the range is not special.  If the first character (possibly
% following a leading |^|) is |]| then it does not need to be escaped
% since ending the range there would make it empty.
% Ranges of characters
% can be expressed using |-|, for instance, |[\D 0-5]| and |[^6-9]| are
% equivalent.
%
% \subsection{Structure: alternatives, groups, repetitions}
%
% Quantifiers (repetition).
% \begin{l3regex-syntax}
%   \item[?] $0$ or $1$, greedy.
%   \item[??] $0$ or $1$, lazy.
%   \item[*] $0$ or more, greedy.
%   \item[*?] $0$ or more, lazy.
%   \item[+] $1$ or more, greedy.
%   \item[+?] $1$ or more, lazy.
%   \item[\{$n$\}] Exactly $n$.
%   \item[\{$n,$\}] $n$ or more, greedy.
%   \item[\{$n,$\}?] $n$ or more, lazy.
%   \item[\{$n,m$\}] At least $n$, no more than $m$, greedy.
%   \item[\{$n,m$\}?] At least $n$, no more than $m$, lazy.
% \end{l3regex-syntax}
% For greedy quantifiers the regex code will first investigate matches
% that involve as many repetitions as possible, while for lazy
% quantifiers it investigates matches with as few repetitions as
% possible first.
%
% Alternation and capturing groups.
% \begin{l3regex-syntax}
%   \item[A\char`|B\char`|C] Either one of \texttt{A}, \texttt{B},
%     or \texttt{C}, investigating \texttt{A} first.
%   \item[(\ldots{})] Capturing group.
%   \item[(?:\ldots{})] Non-capturing group.
%   \item[(?\char`|\ldots{})] Non-capturing group which resets
%     the group number for capturing groups in each alternative.
%     The following group is numbered with the first unused
%     group number.
% \end{l3regex-syntax}
%
% Capturing groups are a means of extracting information about the
% match. Parenthesized groups are labelled in the order of their
% opening parenthesis, starting at $1$. The contents of those groups
% corresponding to the \enquote{best} match (leftmost longest)
% can be extracted and stored in a sequence of token lists using for
% instance \cs{regex_extract_once:nnNTF}.
%
% The |\K| escape sequence resets the beginning of the match to the
% current position in the token list. This only affects what is reported
% as the full match. For instance,
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \regex_extract_all:nnN { a \K . } { a123aaxyz } \l_foo_seq
% \end{verbatim}
% results in \cs[no-index]{l_foo_seq} containing the items |{1}| and |{a}|: the
% true matches are |{a1}| and |{aa}|, but they are trimmed by the use of
% |\K|. The |\K| command does not affect capturing groups: for instance,
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \regex_extract_once:nnN { (. \K c)+ \d } { acbc3 } \l_foo_seq
% \end{verbatim}
% results in \cs[no-index]{l_foo_seq} containing the items |{c3}| and |{bc}|: the
% true match is |{acbc3}|, with first submatch |{bc}|, but |\K| resets
% the beginning of the match to the last position where it appears.
%
% \subsection{Matching exact tokens}
%
% The |\c| escape sequence allows to test the category code of tokens,
% and match control sequences. Each character category is represented
% by a single uppercase letter:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item |C| for control sequences;
% \item |B| for begin-group tokens;
% \item |E| for end-group tokens;
% \item |M| for math shift;
% \item |T| for alignment tab tokens;
% \item |P| for macro parameter tokens;
% \item |U| for superscript tokens (up);
% \item |D| for subscript tokens (down);
% \item |S| for spaces;
% \item |L| for letters;
% \item |O| for others; and
% \item |A| for active characters.
% \end{itemize}
% The |\c| escape sequence is used as follows.
% \begin{l3regex-syntax}
%   \item[\\c\Arg{regex}] A control sequence whose csname matches the
%     \meta{regex}, anchored at the beginning and end, so that |\c{begin}|
%     matches exactly \cs[no-index]{begin}, and nothing else.
%   \item[\\cX] Applies to the next object, which can be a character,
%     escape character sequence such as |\x{0A}|, character class, or
%     group, and forces this object to only match tokens with category
%     |X| (any of |CBEMTPUDSLOA|. For instance, |\cL[A-Z\d]| matches
%     uppercase letters and digits of category code letter, |\cC.|
%     matches any control sequence, and |\cO(abc)| matches |abc| where
%     each character has category other.\footnote{This last example also
%     captures \enquote{\texttt{abc}} as a regex group; to avoid this
%     use a non-capturing group \texttt{\textbackslash cO(?:abc)}.}
%   \item[{\\c[XYZ]}] Applies to the next object, and forces it to only
%     match tokens with category |X|, |Y|, or |Z| (each being any of
%     |CBEMTPUDSLOA|). For instance, |\c[LSO](..)| matches two tokens of
%     category letter, space, or other.
%   \item[{\\c[\char`\^XYZ]}] Applies to the next object and prevents it
%     from matching any token with category |X|, |Y|, or |Z| (each being
%     any of |CBEMTPUDSLOA|). For instance, |\c[^O]\d| matches digits
%     which have any category different from other.
% \end{l3regex-syntax}
% The category code tests can be used inside classes; for instance,
% |[\cO\d \c[LO][A-F]]| matches what \TeX{} considers as hexadecimal
% digits, namely digits with category other, or uppercase letters from
% |A| to |F| with category either letter or other. Within a group
% affected by a category code test, the outer test can be overridden by
% a nested test: for instance, |\cL(ab\cO\*cd)| matches |ab*cd| where
% all characters are of category letter, except |*| which has category
% other.
%
% The |\u| escape sequence allows to insert the contents of a token list
% directly into a regular expression or a replacement, avoiding the need
% to escape special characters. Namely, |\u|\Arg{var~name} matches
% the exact contents (both character codes and category codes) of the
% variable \cs[no-index]{\meta{var~name}},
% which are obtained by applying \cs{exp_not:v} \Arg{var~name} at the
% time the regular expression is compiled. Within a |\c{...}|
% control sequence matching, the |\u| escape sequence only expands its
% argument once, in effect performing \cs{tl_to_str:v}.
% Quantifiers are supported.
%
% The |\ur| escape sequence allows to insert the contents of a |regex|
% variable into a larger regular expression.  For instance,
% |A\ur{l_tmpa_regex}D| matches the tokens |A| and |D| separated by
% something that matches the regular expression
% \cs[no-index]{l_tmpa_regex}.  This behaves as if a non-capturing group
% were surrounding \cs[no-index]{l_tmpa_regex}, and any group contained
% in \cs[no-index]{l_tmpa_regex} is converted to a non-capturing group.
% Quantifiers are supported.
%
% For instance, if \cs[no-index]{l_tmpa_regex} has value \verb"B|C",
% then |A\ur{l_tmpa_regex}D| is equivalent to \verb"A(?:B|C)D" (matching
% |ABD| or |ACD|) and not to \verb"AB|CD" (matching |AB| or |CD|).  To
% get the latter effect, it is simplest to use \TeX{}'s expansion
% machinery directly: if \cs[no-index]{l_mymodule_BC_tl} contains
% \verb"B|C" then the following two lines show the same result:
% \begin{quote}
%   \cs{regex_show:n} |{ A \u{l_mymodule_BC_tl} D }| \\
%   \cs{regex_show:n} \verb"{ A B | C D }"
% \end{quote}
%
% \subsection{Miscellaneous}
%
% Anchors and simple assertions.
% \begin{l3regex-syntax}
%   \item[\\b] Word boundary: either the previous token is matched by
%     |\w| and the next by |\W|, or the opposite. For this purpose,
%     the ends of the token list are considered as |\W|.
%   \item[\\B] Not a word boundary: between two |\w| tokens
%     or two |\W| tokens (including the boundary).
%   \item[\char`^ \textrm{or} \\A]
%     Start of the subject token list.
%   \item[\char`$\textrm{,} \\Z \textrm{or} \\z] ^^A $
%     End of the subject token list.
%   \item[\\G] Start of the current match. This is only different from |^|
%     in the case of multiple matches: for instance
%     |\regex_count:nnN { \G a } { aaba } \l_tmpa_int| yields $2$, but
%     replacing |\G| by |^| would result in \cs{l_tmpa_int} holding the
%     value $1$.
% \end{l3regex-syntax}
%
% The option |(?i)| makes the match case insensitive (treating
% \texttt{A}--\texttt{Z} and \texttt{a}--\texttt{z} as equivalent, with
% no support yet for Unicode case changing). This
% applies until the end of the group in which it appears, and
% can be reverted using |(?-i)|. For instance, in
% \verb"(?i)(a(?-i)b|c)d", the letters |a| and |d| are affected by the
% |i| option. Characters within ranges and classes are affected
% individually: |(?i)[\?-B]| is equivalent to |[\?@ABab]|
% (and differs from the much larger class |[\?-b]|), and
% |(?i)[^aeiou]| matches any character which is not a vowel.
% The |i|~option has no effect on |\c{...}|, on |\u{...}|, on character
% properties, or on character classes, for instance it has no effect at
% all in |(?i)\u{l_foo_tl}\d\d[[:lower:]]|.
%
% \section{Syntax of the replacement text}
%
% Most of the features described in regular expressions do not make
% sense within the replacement text.  Backslash introduces various
% special constructions, described further below:
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item |\0| is the whole match;
%   \item |\1| is the submatch that was matched by the first (capturing)
%     group |(...)|; similarly for |\2|, \ldots{}, |\9| and
%     |\g{|\meta{number}|}|;
%   \item \verb*|\ | inserts a space (spaces are ignored when not
%     escaped);
%   \item |\a|, |\e|, |\f|, |\n|, |\r|, |\t|, |\xhh|, |\x{hhh}|
%     correspond to single characters as in regular expressions;
%   \item |\c|\Arg{cs~name} inserts a control sequence;
%   \item |\c|\meta{category}\meta{character} (see below);
%   \item |\u|\Arg{tl~var~name} inserts the contents of the
%     \meta{tl~var} (see below).
% \end{itemize}
% Characters other than backslash and space are simply inserted in the
% result (but since the replacement text is first converted to a string,
% one should also escape characters that are special for \TeX{}, for
% instance use~|\#|).  Non-alphanumeric characters can always be safely
% escaped with a backslash.
%
% For instance,
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \tl_set:Nn \l_my_tl { Hello,~world! }
%   \regex_replace_all:nnN { ([er]?l|o) . } { (\0--\1) } \l_my_tl
% \end{verbatim}
% results in \cs[no-index]{l_my_tl} holding |H(ell--el)(o,--o) w(or--o)(ld--l)!|
%
% The submatches are numbered according to the order in which the
% opening parenthesis of capturing groups appear in the regular
% expression to match.  The $n$-th submatch is empty if there are fewer
% than $n$ capturing groups or for capturing groups that appear in
% alternatives that were not used for the match.  In case a capturing
% group matches several times during a match (due to quantifiers) only
% the last match is used in the replacement text. Submatches always keep
% the same category codes as in the original token list.
%
% By default, the category code of characters inserted by the
% replacement are determined by the prevailing category code regime at
% the time where the replacement is made, with two exceptions:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item space characters (with character code $32$) inserted with
%   \verb*|\ | or |\x20| or |\x{20}| have category code~$10$ regardless
%   of the prevailing category code regime;
% \item if the category code would be $0$~(escape), $5$~(newline),
%   $9$~(ignore), $14$~(comment) or $15$~(invalid), it is replaced by
%   $12$~(other) instead.
% \end{itemize}
% The escape sequence |\c| allows to insert characters
% with arbitrary category codes, as well as control sequences.
% \begin{l3regex-syntax}
% \item[\\cX(\ldots{})] Produces the characters \enquote{\ldots{}} with
%   category~|X|, which must be one of |CBEMTPUDSLOA| as in regular
%   expressions.  Parentheses are optional for a single character (which
%   can be an escape sequence).  When nested, the innermost category
%   code applies, for instance |\cL(Hello\cS\ world)!| gives this text
%   with standard category codes.
% \item[\\c\Arg{text}] Produces the control sequence with csname
%   \meta{text}.  The \meta{text} may contain references to the
%   submatches |\0|, |\1|, and so on, as in the example for |\u| below.
% \end{l3regex-syntax}
%
% The escape sequence |\u|\Arg{var~name} allows to insert the
% contents of the variable with name \meta{var~name} directly into
% the replacement, giving an easier control of category codes.  When
% nested in |\c{|\ldots{}|}| and |\u{|\ldots{}|}| constructions, the
% |\u| and |\c|~escape sequences perform \cs{tl_to_str:v}, namely
% extract the value of the control sequence and turn it into a string.
% Matches can also be used within the arguments of |\c| and |\u|.  For
% instance,
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \tl_set:Nn \l_my_one_tl { first }

% \section{Pre-compiling regular expressions}
%
% If a regular expression is to be used several times,
% it is better to compile it once rather than doing it
% each time the regular expression is used. The compiled
% regular expression is stored in a variable. All
% of the \pkg{l3regex} module's functions can be given their
% regular expression argument either as an explicit string
% or as a compiled regular expression.
%
% \begin{function}[added = 2017-05-26]{\regex_new:N}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{regex_new:N} \meta{regex~var}
%   \end{syntax}
%   Creates a new \meta{regex~var} or raises an error if the
%   name is already taken. The declaration is global. The
%   \meta{regex~var} is initially such that it never matches.
% \end{function}
%
% \begin{function}[added = 2017-05-26]{\regex_set:Nn, \regex_gset:Nn}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{regex_set:Nn} \meta{regex~var} \Arg{regex}
%   \end{syntax}
%   Stores a compiled version of the \meta{regular expression} in the
%   \meta{regex~var}. The assignment is local for \cs{regex_set:Nn} and
%   global for \cs{regex_gset:Nn}. For instance, this function can be
%   used as
%   \begin{verbatim}
%     \regex_new:N \l_my_regex
%     \regex_set:Nn \l_my_regex { my\ (simple\ )? reg(ex|ular\ expression) }
%   \end{verbatim}
% \end{function}

% \begin{function}[added = 2017-05-26]{\regex_const:Nn}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{regex_const:Nn} \meta{regex~var} \Arg{regex}
%   \end{syntax}
%   Creates a new constant \meta{regex~var} or raises an error if the name
%   is already taken.  The value of the \meta{regex~var} is set
%   globally to the compiled version of the \meta{regular expression}.
% \end{function}
%
% \begin{function}[added = 2021-04-26, updated = 2021-04-29]
%   {\regex_show:N, \regex_show:n, \regex_log:N, \regex_log:n}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{regex_show:n} \Arg{regex}
%     \cs{regex_log:n} \Arg{regex}
%   \end{syntax}
%   Displays in the terminal or writes in the log file (respectively)
%   how \pkg{l3regex} interprets the \meta{regex}. For instance,
%   \cs{regex_show:n} \verb+{\A X|Y}+ shows
%   \begin{verbatim}
%     +-branch
%       anchor at start (\A)
%       char code 88 (X)
%     +-branch
%       char code 89 (Y)
%   \end{verbatim}
%   indicating that the anchor |\A| only applies to the first branch:
%   the second branch is not anchored to the beginning of the match.
% \end{function}
%
% \section{Matching}
%
% All regular expression functions are available in both |:n| and |:N|
% variants. The former require a \enquote{standard} regular expression,
% while the later require a compiled expression as generated by
% \cs{regex_set:Nn}.

%     \cs{regex_match:nnTF} \Arg{regex} \Arg{token list} \Arg{true code} \Arg{false code}
%   \end{syntax}
%   Tests whether the \meta{regular expression} matches any part
%   of the \meta{token list}. For instance,
%   \begin{verbatim}
%     \regex_match:nnTF { b [cde]* } { abecdcx } { TRUE } { FALSE }
%     \regex_match:nnTF { [b-dq-w] } { example } { TRUE } { FALSE }

%   }
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{regex_count:nnN} \Arg{regex} \Arg{token list} \meta{int var}
%   \end{syntax}
%   Sets \meta{int var} within the current \TeX{} group level
%   equal to the number of times
%   \meta{regular expression} appears in \meta{token list}.
%   The search starts by finding the left-most longest match,
%   respecting greedy and lazy (non-greedy) operators. Then the search
%   starts again from the character following the last character
%   of the previous match, until reaching the end of the token list.
%   Infinite loops are prevented in the case where the regular expression
%   can match an empty token list: then we count one match between each
%   pair of characters.
%   For instance,
%   \begin{verbatim}
%     \int_new:N \l_foo_int
%     \regex_count:nnN { (b+|c) } { abbababcbb } \l_foo_int

%     ~~|}| \Arg{token list}
%     ~~\Arg{true code} \Arg{false code}
%   \end{syntax}
%   Determines which of the \meta{regular expressions} matches at the
%   earliest point in the \meta{token list}, and leaves the
%   corresponding \meta{code_i} followed by the \meta{true code} in the
%   input stream.  If several \meta{regex} match starting at the same
%   point, then the first one in the list is selected and the others are
%   discarded.  If none of the \meta{regex} match, the \meta{false code}
%   is left in the input stream.  Each \meta{regex} can either be given
%   as a regex variable or as an explicit regular expression.
%
%   In detail, for each starting position in the \meta{token list}, each
%   of the \meta{regex} is searched in turn.  If one of them matches
%   then the corresponding \meta{code} is used and everything else is
%   discarded, while if none of the \meta{regex} match at a given
%   position then the next starting position is attempted.  If none of
%   the \meta{regex} match anywhere in the \meta{token list} then
%   nothing is left in the input stream.  Note that this differs from
%   nested \cs{regex_match:nnTF} statements since all \meta{regex} are
%   attempted at each position rather than attempting to match
%   \meta{regex_1} at every position before moving on to \meta{regex_2}.

%
% \begin{function}[noTF, added = 2017-05-26]

%     \cs{regex_extract_once:nnNTF} \Arg{regex} \Arg{token list} \meta{seq~var} \Arg{true code} \Arg{false code}
%   \end{syntax}
%   Finds the first match of the \meta{regular expression} in the
%   \meta{token list}. If it exists, the match is stored as the first
%   item of the \meta{seq~var}, and further items are the contents of
%   capturing groups, in the order of their opening parenthesis. The
%   \meta{seq~var} is assigned locally. If there is no match, the
%   \meta{seq~var} is cleared.  The testing versions insert the
%   \meta{true code} into the input stream if a match was found, and the
%   \meta{false code} otherwise.
%
%   For instance, assume that you type
%   \begin{verbatim}
%     \regex_extract_once:nnNTF { \A(La)?TeX(!*)\Z } { LaTeX!!! } \l_foo_seq
%       { true } { false }
%   \end{verbatim}
%   Then the regular expression (anchored at the start with |\A| and
%   at the end with |\Z|) must match the whole token list. The first
%   capturing group, |(La)?|, matches |La|, and the second capturing
%   group, |(!*)|, matches |!!!|. Thus, \cs[no-index]{l_foo_seq} contains as a result
%   the items |{LaTeX!!!}|, |{La}|, and |{!!!}|, and the \texttt{true}
%   branch is left in the input stream.
%   Note that the $n$-th item of \cs[no-index]{l_foo_seq}, as obtained using
%   \cs{seq_item:Nn}, correspond to the submatch numbered $(n-1)$ in
%   functions such as \cs{regex_replace_once:nnN}.

%   \end{syntax}
%   Finds all matches of the \meta{regular expression}
%   in the \meta{token list}, and stores all the submatch information
%   in a single sequence (concatenating the results of
%   multiple \cs{regex_extract_once:nnN} calls).
%   The \meta{seq~var} is assigned locally. If there is no match,
%   the \meta{seq~var} is cleared.
%   The testing versions insert the \meta{true code} into the input
%   stream if a match was found, and the \meta{false code} otherwise.
%   For instance, assume that you type
%   \begin{verbatim}
%     \regex_extract_all:nnNTF { \w+ } { Hello,~world! } \l_foo_seq
%       { true } { false }
%   \end{verbatim}
%   Then the regular expression matches twice, the resulting

%   \end{syntax}
%   Splits the \meta{token list} into a sequence of parts, delimited by
%   matches of the \meta{regular expression}. If the \meta{regular expression}
%   has capturing groups, then the token lists that they match are stored as
%   items of the sequence as well. The assignment to \meta{seq~var} is local.
%   If no match is found the resulting \meta{seq~var} has the
%   \meta{token list} as its sole item. If the \meta{regular expression}
%   matches the empty token list, then the \meta{token list} is split
%   into single tokens.
%   The testing versions insert the \meta{true code} into the input
%   stream if a match was found, and the \meta{false code} otherwise.
%   For example, after
%   \begin{verbatim}
%     \seq_new:N \l_path_seq
%     \regex_split:nnNTF { / } { the/path/for/this/file.tex } \l_path_seq
%       { true } { false }
%   \end{verbatim}
%   the sequence |\l_path_seq| contains the items |{the}|, |{path}|,

% \section{Bugs, misfeatures, future work, and other possibilities}
%
% The following need to be done now.
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item Rewrite the documentation in a more ordered way, perhaps add a
%     \textsc{bnf}?
% \end{itemize}
%
% Additional error-checking to come.
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item Clean up the use of messages.
%   \item Cleaner error reporting in the replacement phase.
%   \item Add tracing information.
%   \item Detect attempts to use back-references and other
%     non-implemented syntax.
%   \item Test for the maximum register \cs[no-index]{c_max_register_int}.
%   \item Find out whether the fact that |\W| and friends match the
%     end-marker leads to bugs. Possibly update \cs[no-index]{__regex_item_reverse:n}.
%   \item The empty cs should be matched by |\c{}|, not by
%     |\c{csname.?endcsname\s?}|.
% \end{itemize}
%
% Code improvements to come.
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item Shift arrays so that the useful information starts at
%     position~$1$.
%   \item Only build |\c{...}| once.
%   \item Use arrays for the left and right state stacks when
%     compiling a regex.
%   \item Should \cs[no-index]{__regex_action_free_group:n} only be used for greedy
%     |{n,}| quantifier? (I think not.)
%   \item Quantifiers for |\u| and assertions.
%   \item When matching, keep track of an explicit stack of
%     \texttt{curr_state} and \texttt{curr_submatches}.
%   \item If possible, when a state is reused by the same thread, kill
%     other subthreads.
%   \item Use an array rather than \cs[no-index]{g__regex_balance_tl}
%     to build the function \cs[no-index]{__regex_replacement_balance_one_match:n}.
%   \item Reduce the number of epsilon-transitions in alternatives.
%   \item Optimize simple strings: use less states (|abcade| should give
%     two states, for |abc| and |ade|). [Does that really make sense?]
%   \item Optimize groups with no alternative.
%   \item Optimize states with a single \cs[no-index]{__regex_action_free:n}.
%   \item Optimize the use of \cs[no-index]{__regex_action_success:} by inserting it
%     in state $2$ directly instead of having an extra transition.
%   \item Optimize the use of \cs[no-index]{int_step_...} functions.
%   \item Groups don't capture within regexes for csnames; optimize and
%     document.
%   \item Better \enquote{show} for anchors, properties, and catcode tests.
%   \item Does |\K| really need a new state for itself?
%   \item When compiling, use a boolean \texttt{in_cs} and less magic
%     numbers.
%   \item Instead of checking whether the character is special or
%     alphanumeric using its character code, check if it is special in
%     regexes with \cs[no-index]{cs_if_exist} tests.
% \end{itemize}
%
% The following features are likely to be implemented at some point
% in the future.
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item General look-ahead/behind assertions.
%   \item Regex matching on external files.
%   \item Conditional subpatterns with look ahead/behind: \enquote{if
%       what follows is [\ldots{}], then [\ldots{}]}.
%   \item |(*..)| and |(?..)| sequences to set some options.
%   \item UTF-8 mode for \pdfTeX{}.
%   \item Newline conventions are not done.
%     In particular, we should have an option for |.| not to match newlines.
%     Also, |\A| should differ from |^|, and |\Z|, |\z| and |$| should
%     differ.
%   \item Unicode properties: |\p{..}| and |\P{..}|;
%     |\X| which should match any \enquote{extended} Unicode sequence.
%     This requires to manipulate a lot of data, probably using tree-boxes.
% \end{itemize}
%
% The following features of \textsc{pcre} or Perl may or may not be
% implemented.
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item Callout with |(?C...)| or other syntax: some internal code
%     changes make that possible, and it can be useful for instance in
%     the replacement code to stop a regex replacement when some marker
%     has been found; this raises the question of a potential
%     |\regex_break:| and then of playing well with \cs{tl_map_break:}
%     called from within the code in a regex.  It also raises the
%     question of nested calls to the regex machinery, which is a
%     problem since \tn{fontdimen} are global.
%   \item Conditional subpatterns (other than with a look-ahead or
%     look-behind condition): this is non-regular, isn't it?
%   \item Named subpatterns: \TeX{} programmers have lived so far
%     without any need for named macro parameters.
% \end{itemize}
%
% The following features of \textsc{pcre} or Perl will definitely not be
% implemented.
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item Back-references: non-regular feature, this requires
%     backtracking, which is prohibitively slow.
%   \item Recursion: this is a non-regular feature.
%   \item Atomic grouping, possessive quantifiers: those tools, mostly
%     meant to fix catastrophic backtracking, are unnecessary in a

%   \item Backtracking control verbs: intrinsically tied to

%
% \subsection{Plan of attack}
%
% Most regex engines use backtracking. This allows to provide very
% powerful features (back-references come to mind first), but it is
% costly, and raises the problem of catastrophic backtracking. Since
% \TeX{} is not first and foremost a programming language, complicated
% code tends to run slowly, and we must use faster, albeit slightly more
% restrictive, techniques, coming from automata theory.
%
% Given a regular expression of $n$ characters, we do the following:
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item (Compiling.) Analyse the regex, finding invalid input, and
%     convert it to an internal representation.
%   \item (Building.) Convert the compiled regex to a non-deterministic
%     finite automaton (\textsc{nfa}) with $O(n)$ states which
%     accepts precisely token lists matching that regex.
%   \item (Matching.) Loop through the query token list one token (one
%     \enquote{position}) at a time, exploring in parallel every
%     possible path (\enquote{active thread}) through the \textsc{nfa},
%     considering active threads in an order determined by the
%     quantifiers' greediness.
% \end{itemize}
%
% We use the following vocabulary in the code comments (and in variable
% names).
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item \emph{Group}: index of the capturing group, $-1$ for
%     non-capturing groups. ^^A start/end index?
%   \item \emph{Position}: each token in the query is labelled by an
%     integer \meta{position}, with $\texttt{min_pos} - 1 \leq
%     \meta{position} \leq \texttt{max_pos}$. The lowest and highest
%     positions $\texttt{min_pos} - 1$ and $\texttt{max_pos}$
%     correspond to imaginary begin and end markers (with
%     non-existent category code and character code).
%     $\texttt{max_pos}$ is only set quite late in the processing.
%   \item \emph{Query}: the token list to which we apply the regular
%     expression.
%   \item \emph{State}: each state of the \textsc{nfa} is labelled by an
%     integer \meta{state} with $\texttt{min_state} \leq \meta{state} <
%     \texttt{max_state}$.
%   \item \emph{Active thread}: state of the \textsc{nfa} that is reached
%     when reading the query token list for the matching. Those threads
%     are ordered according to the greediness of quantifiers.
%   \item \emph{Step}: used when matching, starts at $0$, incremented
%     every time a character is read, and is not reset when searching
%     for repeated matches. The integer \cs{l_@@_step_int} is a
%     unique id for all the steps of the matching algorithm.
% \end{itemize}
%
% We use \pkg{l3intarray} to manipulate arrays of integers.
% We also abuse \TeX{}'s
% \tn{toks} registers, by accessing them directly by number rather than
% tying them to control sequence using the \tn{newtoks} allocation
% functions. Specifically, these arrays and \tn{toks} are used as
% follows.  When building,
% \tn{toks}\meta{state} holds the tests and actions to perform in the
% \meta{state} of the \textsc{nfa}.  When matching,
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item \cs{g_@@_state_active_intarray} holds the last \meta{step} in
%     which each \meta{state} was active.
%   \item \cs{g_@@_thread_info_intarray} consists of blocks for each
%     \meta{thread} (with $\texttt{min_thread} \leq \meta{thread} <
%     \texttt{max_thread}$).  Each block has
%     $1+2\cs{l_@@_capturing_group_int}$ entries: the \meta{state} in
%     which the \meta{thread} currently is, followed by the beginnings
%     of all submatches, and then the ends of all submatches. The
%     \meta{threads} are ordered starting from the best to the least
%     preferred.
%   \item \cs{g_@@_submatch_prev_intarray}, \cs{g_@@_submatch_begin_intarray}
%     and \cs{g_@@_submatch_end_intarray} hold, for each submatch (as would
%     be extracted by \cs{regex_extract_all:nnN}), the place where the
%     submatch started to be looked for and its two end-points.  For
%     historical reasons, the minimum index is twice \texttt{max_state},
%     and the used registers go up to \cs{l_@@_submatch_int}. They are
%     organized in blocks of \cs{l_@@_capturing_group_int} entries, each
%     block corresponding to one match with all its submatches stored in
%     consecutive entries.
% \end{itemize}
% When actually building the result,
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item \tn{toks}\meta{position} holds \meta{tokens} which \texttt{o}-
%     and \texttt{x}-expand to the \meta{position}-th token in the query.
%   \item \cs{g_@@_balance_intarray} holds the balance of begin-group and
%     end-group character tokens which appear before that point in the
%     token list.
% \end{itemize}
%
% The code is structured as follows. Variables are introduced in the
% relevant section. First we present some generic helper functions. Then
% comes the code for compiling a regular expression, and for showing the
% result of the compilation. The building phase converts a compiled
% regex to \textsc{nfa} states, and the automaton is run by the code in
% the following section. The only remaining brick is parsing the
% replacement text and performing the replacement. We are then ready for
% all the user functions. Finally, messages, and a little bit of tracing
% code.

% \subsubsection{Simple character escape}
%
% Before actually parsing the regular expression or the replacement
% text, we go through them once, converting |\n| to the character $10$,
% \emph{etc.} In this pass, we also convert any special character
% (\texttt{*}, \texttt{?}, \texttt{\{}, etc.) or escaped alphanumeric
% character into a marker indicating that this was a special sequence,
% and replace escaped special characters and non-escaped alphanumeric
% characters by markers indicating that those were \enquote{raw}
% characters. The rest of the code can then avoid caring about escaping
% issues (those can become quite complex to handle in combination with
% ranges in character classes).
%
% Usage: \cs{@@_escape_use:nnnn} \meta{inline~1} \meta{inline~2}
% \meta{inline~3} \Arg{token list} The \meta{token list} is converted to
% a string, then read from left to right, interpreting backslashes as
% escaping the next character.  Unescaped characters are fed to the
% function \meta{inline~1}, and escaped characters are fed to the function
% \meta{inline~2} within an \texttt{x}-expansion context (typically those
% functions perform some tests on their argument to decide how to output
% them).  The escape sequences |\a|, |\e|, |\f|, |\n|, |\r|, |\t| and
% |\x| are recognized, and those are replaced by the corresponding
% character, then fed to \meta{inline~3}. The result is then left in the
% input stream. Spaces are ignored unless escaped.
%
% The conversion is done within an \texttt{x}-expanding assignment.
%
% \begin{macro}{\@@_escape_use:nnnn}
%   The result is built in \cs{l_@@_internal_a_tl}, which is then left
%   in the input stream.  Tracing code is added as appropriate inside
%   this token list.  Go through |#4| once, applying |#1|,
%   |#2|, or |#3| as relevant to each character (after de-escaping
%   it).

% \subsection{Compiling}
%
% A regular expression starts its life as a string of characters. In
% this section, we convert it to internal instructions, resulting in a
% \enquote{compiled} regular expression. This compiled expression is
% then turned into states of an automaton in the building
% phase. Compiled regular expressions consist of the following:
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item \cs{@@_class:NnnnN} \meta{boolean} \Arg{tests} \Arg{min}
%     \Arg{more} \meta{lazyness}
%   \item \cs{@@_group:nnnN} \Arg{branches} \Arg{min} \Arg{more}
%     \meta{lazyness}, also \cs{@@_group_no_capture:nnnN} and
%     \cs{@@_group_resetting:nnnN} with the same syntax.
%   \item \cs{@@_branch:n} \Arg{contents}
%   \item \cs{@@_command_K:}
%   \item \cs{@@_assertion:Nn} \meta{boolean} \Arg{assertion test},
%     where the \meta{assertion test} is \cs{@@_b_test:} or
%     \cs{@@_Z_test:} or \cs{@@_A_test:} or \cs{@@_G_test:}
% \end{itemize}
% Tests can be the following:
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item \cs{@@_item_caseful_equal:n} \Arg{char code}
%   \item \cs{@@_item_caseless_equal:n} \Arg{char code}
%   \item \cs{@@_item_caseful_range:nn} \Arg{min} \Arg{max}
%   \item \cs{@@_item_caseless_range:nn} \Arg{min} \Arg{max}
%   \item \cs{@@_item_catcode:nT} \Arg{catcode bitmap} \Arg{tests}
%   \item \cs{@@_item_catcode_reverse:nT} \Arg{catcode bitmap} \Arg{tests}
%   \item \cs{@@_item_reverse:n} \Arg{tests}
%   \item \cs{@@_item_exact:nn} \Arg{catcode} \Arg{char code}
%   \item \cs{@@_item_exact_cs:n} \Arg{csnames}, more precisely given as
%     \meta{csname} \cs{scan_stop:} \meta{csname} \cs{scan_stop:}
%     \meta{csname} and so on in a brace group.
%   \item \cs{@@_item_cs:n} \Arg{compiled regex}
% \end{itemize}

% \subsubsection{Variables used when compiling}
%
% \begin{variable}{\l_@@_group_level_int}

%     \c_@@_class_mode_int,
%     \c_@@_catcode_in_class_mode_int
%   }
%   While compiling, ten modes are recognized, labelled $-63$, $-23$,
%   $-6$, $-2$, $0$, $2$, $3$, $6$, $23$, $63$. See
%   section~\ref{sec:regex-modes}.  We only define some of these as

%   We wish to allow constructions such as |\c[^BE](..\cL[a-z]..)|,
%   where the outer catcode test applies to the whole group, but is
%   superseded by the inner catcode test. For this to work, we need to
%   keep track of lists of allowed category codes:
%   \cs{l_@@_catcodes_int} and \cs{l_@@_default_catcodes_int} are
%   bitmaps, sums of $4^c$, for all allowed catcodes $c$. The latter is
%   local to each capturing group, and we reset
%   \cs{l_@@_catcodes_int} to that value after each character or
%   class, changing it only when encountering a |\c| escape. The boolean
%   records whether the list of categories of a catcode test has to be
%   inverted: compare |\c[^BE]| and |\c[BE]|.

%
% \subsubsection{Mode}
% \label{sec:regex-modes}
%
% When compiling the \textsc{nfa} corresponding to a given regex string,
% we can be in ten distinct modes, which we label by some magic numbers:
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item[-6] |[\c{...}]| control sequence in a class,
%   \item[-2] |\c{...}| control sequence,
%   \item[0] |...| outer,
%   \item[2] |\c...| catcode test,
%   \item[6] |[\c...]| catcode test in a class,
%   \item[-63] |[\c{[...]}]| class inside mode $-6$,
%   \item[-23] |\c{[...]}| class inside mode $-2$,
%   \item[3] |[...]| class inside mode $0$,
%   \item[23] |\c[...]| class inside mode $2$,
%   \item[63] |[\c[...]]| class inside mode $6$.
% \end{itemize}
% This list is exhaustive, because |\c| escape sequences cannot be
% nested, and character classes cannot be nested directly. The choice of
% numbers is such as to optimize the most useful tests, and make
% transitions from one mode to another as simple as possible.
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item Even modes mean that we are not directly in a character class.
%     In this case, a left bracket appends $3$ to the mode. In a
%     character class, a right bracket changes the mode as $m\to
%     (m-15)/13$, truncated.
%   \item Grouping, assertion, and anchors are allowed in non-positive
%     even modes ($0$, $-2$, $-6$), and do not change the
%     mode. Otherwise, they trigger an error.
%   \item A left bracket is special in even modes, appending $3$ to the
%     mode; in those modes, quantifiers and the dot are recognized, and
%     the right bracket is normal. In odd modes (within classes), the
%     left bracket is normal, but the right bracket ends the class,
%     changing the mode from $m$ to $(m-15)/13$, truncated; also, ranges
%     are recognized.
%   \item In non-negative modes, left and right braces are normal. In
%     negative modes, however, left braces trigger a warning; right
%     braces end the control sequence, going from $-2$ to $0$ or $-6$ to
%     $3$, with error recovery for odd modes.
%   \item Properties (such as the |\d| character class) can appear in
%     any mode.
% \end{itemize}
%
% \begin{macro}[EXP]{\@@_if_in_class:TF}
%   Test whether we are directly in a character class (at the innermost

% \subsection{Building}
%
% \subsubsection{Variables used while building}
%
% \begin{variable}{\l_@@_min_state_int, \l_@@_max_state_int}
%   The last state that was allocated is
%   $\cs{l_@@_max_state_int}-1$, so that \cs{l_@@_max_state_int} always
%   points to a free state.  The \texttt{min_state} variable is
%   $1$ to begin with, but gets shifted in nested calls to the matching
%   code, namely in |\c{...}| constructions.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\int_new:N  \l_@@_min_state_int
\int_set:Nn \l_@@_min_state_int { 1 }
\int_new:N  \l_@@_max_state_int
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{variable}
%
% \begin{variable}{\l_@@_left_state_int, \l_@@_right_state_int}
% \begin{variable}{\l_@@_left_state_seq, \l_@@_right_state_seq}
%   Alternatives are implemented by branching from a \texttt{left} state
%   into the various choices, then merging those into a \texttt{right}
%   state. We store information about those states in two sequences.
%   Those states are also used to implement group quantifiers. Most
%   often, the left and right pointers only differ by~$1$.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\int_new:N  \l_@@_left_state_int
\int_new:N  \l_@@_right_state_int
\seq_new:N  \l_@@_left_state_seq
\seq_new:N  \l_@@_right_state_seq
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{variable}
% \end{variable}
%
% \begin{variable}{\l_@@_capturing_group_int}
%   \cs{l_@@_capturing_group_int} is the next \textsc{id} number to
%   be assigned to a capturing group. This starts
%   at $0$ for the group enclosing the full regular expression, and
%   groups are counted in the order of their left parenthesis, except
%   when encountering \texttt{resetting} groups.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\int_new:N  \l_@@_capturing_group_int
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{variable}
%
% \subsubsection{Framework}
%
% This phase is about going from a compiled regex to an \textsc{nfa}.
% Each state of the \textsc{nfa} is stored in a \tn{toks}. The
% operations which can appear in the \tn{toks} are
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item \cs{@@_action_start_wildcard:N} \meta{boolean} inserted at the
%     start of the regular expression, where a \texttt{true}
%     \meta{boolean} makes it unanchored.
%   \item \cs{@@_action_success:} marks the exit state of the
%     \textsc{nfa}.
%   \item \cs{@@_action_cost:n} \Arg{shift} is a transition from the
%     current \meta{state} to $\meta{state}+\meta{shift}$, which
%     consumes the current character: the target state is saved and will
%     be considered again when matching at the next position.
%   \item \cs{@@_action_free:n} \Arg{shift}, and
%     \cs{@@_action_free_group:n} \Arg{shift} are free transitions,
%     which immediately perform the actions for the state
%     $\meta{state}+\meta{shift}$ of the \textsc{nfa}. They differ in
%     how they detect and avoid infinite loops. For now, we just need to
%     know that the \texttt{group} variant must be used for transitions
%     back to the start of a group.
%   \item \cs{@@_action_submatch:nN} \Arg{group} \meta{key} where the
%     \meta{key} is |<| or |>| for the beginning or end of group
%     numbered \meta{group}.  This causes the current position in the
%     query to be stored as the \meta{key} submatch boundary.
%   \item One of these actions, within a conditional.
% \end{itemize}
%
% We strive to preserve the following properties while building.
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item The current capturing group is
%     $\text{\texttt{capturing_group}}-1$, and if a group opened now
%     it would be labelled \texttt{capturing_group}.
%   \item The last allocated state is $\text{\texttt{max_state}}-1$, so
%     \texttt{max_state} is a free state.
%   \item The \texttt{left_state} points to a state to the left of the
%     current group or of the last class.
%   \item The \texttt{right_state} points to a newly created,
%     empty state, with some transitions leading to it.
%   \item The \texttt{left/right} sequences hold a list of the
%     corresponding end-points of nested groups.
% \end{itemize}
%
% \begin{macro}{\@@_build:n, \@@_build_aux:Nn, \@@_build:N, \@@_build_aux:NN}

%   This function is called to repeat a group at least $n$ times; the

%   Insert submatch tracking information at the start and end of the
%   group, add a free transition from the right end to the
%   \enquote{true} left state \texttt{a} (remember: in this case we had
%   added an extra state before the left state). This forms the loop,
%   which we break away from by adding a free transition from \texttt{a}
%   to a new state.
%
%   Now consider the case $n>0$. Repeat the group $n$ times, chaining
%   various copies with a free transition. Add submatch tracking only to
%   the last copy, then add a free transition from the right end back to
%   the left end of the last copy, either before or after the transition
%   to move on towards the rest of the \textsc{nfa}. This transition can
%   end up before submatch tracking, but that is irrelevant since it
%   only does so when going again through the group, recording new

%   We wish to repeat the group between |#2| and $|#2|+|#3|$ times, with
%   a lazyness controlled by |#4|. We insert submatch tracking up front:
%   in principle, we could avoid recording submatches for the first |#2|
%   copies of the group, but that forces us to treat specially the case
%   $|#2|=0$. Repeat that group with submatch tracking $|#2|+|#3|$ times
%   (the maximum number of repetitions). Then our goal is to add |#3|
%   transitions from the end of the |#2|-th group, and each subsequent
%   groups, to the end. For a lazy quantifier, we add those transitions
%   to the left states, before submatch tracking. For the greedy case,
%   we add the transitions to the right states, after submatch tracking
%   and the transitions which go on with more repetitions. In the greedy
%   case with $|#2|=0$, the transition which skips over all copies of
%   the group must be added separately, because its starting state does
%   not follow the normal pattern: we had to add it \enquote{by hand}

% \subsection{Matching}
%
% We search for matches by running all the execution threads through the
% \textsc{nfa} in parallel, reading one token of the query at each step.
% The \textsc{nfa} contains \enquote{free} transitions to other states,
% and transitions which \enquote{consume} the current token.  For free
% transitions, the instruction at the new state of the \textsc{nfa} is
% performed immediately.  When a transition consumes a character, the
% new state is appended to a list of \enquote{active states}, stored in
% \cs{g_@@_thread_info_intarray} (together with submatch information):
% this thread is made active again when the next
% token is read from the query.  At every step (for each token in the
% query), we unpack that list of active states and the corresponding
% submatch props, and empty those.
%
% If two paths through the \textsc{nfa} \enquote{collide} in the sense
% that they reach the same state after reading a given token, then they
% only differ in how they previously matched, and any future execution
% would be identical for both. (Note that this would be wrong in the
% presence of back-references.) Hence, we only need to keep one of the
% two threads: the thread with the highest priority. Our \textsc{nfa} is
% built in such a way that higher priority actions always come before
% lower priority actions, which makes things work.
%
% The explanation in the previous paragraph may make us think that we
% simply need to keep track of which states were visited at a given
% step: after all, the loop generated when matching |(a?)*| against |a|
% is broken, isn't it? No. The group first matches |a|, as it should,
% then repeats; it attempts to match |a| again but fails; it skips |a|,
% and finds out that this state has already been seen at this position
% in the query: the match stops. The capturing group is (wrongly) |a|.
% What went wrong is that a thread collided with itself, and the later
% version, which has gone through the group one more times with an empty
% match, should have a higher priority than not going through the group.
%
% We solve this by distinguishing \enquote{normal} free transitions
% \cs{@@_action_free:n} from transitions
% \cs{@@_action_free_group:n} which go back to the start of the
% group. The former keeps threads unless they have been visited by a
% \enquote{completed} thread, while the latter kind of transition also
% prevents going back to a state visited by the current thread.

%   first to $\texttt{max_pos}-1$ for the last, and their information is
%   stored in several arrays and \tn{toks} registers with those numbers.
%   We match
%   without backtracking, keeping all threads in lockstep at the
%   \texttt{curr_pos} in the query. The starting point of the current
%   match attempt is \texttt{start_pos}, and \texttt{success_pos},
%   updated whenever a thread succeeds, is used as the next starting
%   position.

%   into an intarray variable, to be retrieved when matching at the next

%   \cs{l_@@_curr_state_int} and of the current submatches.  The
%   two types of free transitions differ by how they test that the state
%   has not been encountered yet: the \texttt{group} version is
%   stricter, and will not use a state if it was used earlier in the

%   can be used within an integer expression to obtain the brace balance
%   incurred by performing the replacement on that match. This combines
%   the braces lost by removing the match, braces added by all the
%   submatches appearing in the replacement, and braces appearing
%   explicitly in the replacement. Even though it is always redefined
%   before use, we initialize it as for an empty replacement. An

%   \cs{exp_not:n} requires a braced argument. As far as I can tell, it
%   is only needed if the user tries to include in the replacement text
%   a control sequence set equal to a macro parameter character, such as
%   \cs{c_parameter_token}. Indeed, within an \texttt{x}-expanding
%   assignment, \cs{exp_not:N}~|#| behaves as a single |#|, whereas
%   \cs{exp_not:n}~|{#}| behaves as a doubled |##|.

%
% \begin{macro}[rEXP]{\@@_query_range:nn}
% \begin{macro}[rEXP]{\@@_query_range_loop:ww}
%   When it is time to extract submatches from the token list, the
%   various tokens are stored in \tn{toks} registers numbered from
%   \cs{l_@@_min_pos_int} inclusive to \cs{l_@@_max_pos_int}
%   exclusive. The function \cs{@@_query_range:nn} \Arg{min}
%   \Arg{max} unpacks registers from the position \meta{min} to the
%   position $\meta{max}-1$ included. Once this is expanded, a second
%   \texttt{x}-expansion results in the actual tokens from the
%   query. That second expansion is only done by user functions at the
%   very end of their operation, after checking (and correcting) the
%   brace balance first.

%   the zeroth submatch. This is inhibited if the delimiter matched an
%   empty token list at the start of this match attempt.  After the last
%   match, store the last part of the token list, which ranges from the
%   start of the match attempt to the end of the query. This step is
%   inhibited if the last match was empty and at the very end: decrement
%   \cs{l_@@_submatch_int}, which controls which matches will be used.
