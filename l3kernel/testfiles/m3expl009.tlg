(LaTeX3)                 The version of expl3 preloaded in LaTeX is
(LaTeX3)                 WRONG-DATE, but the version of expl3 you are trying
(LaTeX3)                 to load is dated ....-..-... This is most likely
(LaTeX3)                 due to a stray format file in the user tree. Please
(LaTeX3)                 make sure that your LaTeX format is updated.
Type <return> to continue.

LaTeX does not know anything more about this error, sorry.
Try typing <return> to proceed.
If that doesn't work, type X <return> to quit.
Reading the current file 'expl3' will stop.
