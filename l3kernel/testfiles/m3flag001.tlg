LaTeX has been asked to create a new control sequence '\l_A_flag' but this
name has already been used elsewhere.
The current meaning is:

If you say, e.g., `\def\a1{...}', then you must always
put `1' after `\a', since control sequence names are
made up of letters only. The macro here has not been
followed by the required stuff, so I'm ignoring it.
