LaTeX has been asked to create a new control sequence '\flag A' but this name
has already been used elsewhere.
The current meaning is:
  \long macro:#1;->\exp_after:wN \use_none:n \cs:w flag A #1\cs_end: 
Defining \flag A on line ...
Defining \flag B on line ...

If you say, e.g., `\def\a1{...}', then you must always
put `1' after `\a', since control sequence names are
made up of letters only. The macro here has not been
followed by the required stuff, so I'm ignoring it.
