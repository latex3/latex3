FALSE
! Undefined control sequence.
<argument> \LaTeX3 error: 
                           Invalid operation (0)*(inf)
l. ...  }
The control sequence at the end of the top line
of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
and I'll forget about whatever was undefined.

FALSE
! Undefined control sequence.
<argument> \LaTeX3 error:

of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have

TEST 2: fp_trap:nn error recovery
============================================================
! LaTeX3 Error: The FPU exception 'foo' is not known: that trap will never be
(LaTeX3)        triggered.
For immediate help type H <return>.
 ...                                              
l. ...  }
The only exceptions to which traps can be attached are
    * invalid_operation
    * division_by_zero
    * overflow
    * underflow
! LaTeX3 Error: The FPU trap type 'bar' is not known.
For immediate help type H <return>.
 ...                                              
l. ...  }
The trap type must be one of
    * error
    * flag
    * none
