FALSE
! Use of \??? doesn't match its definition.

                 ! LaTeX3 Error: Invalid operation (0)*(inf)
l. ...  }
If you say, e.g., `\def\a1{...}', then you must always
put `1' after `\a', since control sequence names are
made up of letters only. The macro here has not been
followed by the required stuff, so I'm ignoring it.

TEST 2: fp_trap:nn error recovery
============================================================
! LaTeX3 Error: The FPU exception 'foo' is not known: that trap will never be
(LaTeX3)        triggered.
For immediate help type H <return>.
 ...                                              
l. ...  }
The only exceptions to which traps can be attached are
    * invalid_operation
    * division_by_zero
    * overflow
    * underflow
! LaTeX3 Error: The FPU trap type 'bar' is not known.
For immediate help type H <return>.
 ...                                              
l. ...  }
The trap type must be one of
    * error
    * flag
    * none
