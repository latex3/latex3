TEST 2: Safe array operations with errors

This is a coding error.
LaTeX has been asked to create a new control sequence '\g_testa_fparray' but
this name has already been used elsewhere.
The current meaning is:
  macro:->\g__fp_array_i_intarray \g__fp_array_ii_intarray
\g__fp_array_iii_intarray

If you say, e.g., `\def\a1{...}', then you must always
put `1' after `\a', since control sequence names are
made up of letters only. The macro here has not been
followed by the required stuff, so I'm ignoring it.
