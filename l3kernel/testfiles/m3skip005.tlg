! Undefined control sequence.

l. ...  }
The control sequence at the end of the top line
of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
and I'll forget about whatever was undefined.

! Missing = inserted for \ifdim.
<to be read again> 
                   p

I was expecting to see `<', `=', or `>'. Didn't.
! Missing number, treated as zero.
<to be read again> 
                   p
l. ...  }
A number should have been here; I inserted `0'.
(If you can't figure out why I needed to see a number,
look up `weird error' in the index to The TeXbook.)
! Illegal unit of measure (pt inserted).
<to be read again> 
                   m
l. ...  }
Dimensions can be in units of em, ex, in, pt, pc,
cm, mm, dd, cc, nd, nc, bp, or sp; but yours is a new one!
I'll assume that you meant to say pt, for printer's points.
To recover gracefully from this error, it's best to
delete the erroneous units; e.g., type `2' to delete
two letters. (See Chapter 27 of The TeXbook.)
