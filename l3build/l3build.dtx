% \section{Introduction}
%
% The \pkg{l3build} system is a Lua script for building \TeX{} packages, with particular emphasis on regression testing.
% It is written in cross-platform Lua code, so can be used by any modern \TeX{} distribution with the |texlua| interpreter.
%
% An \pkg{l3build} script is also written in Lua, in which various settings are defined for the requirements of its package.
% A package can be written in any \TeX\ dialect; its defaults are set up for \LaTeX\ packages written in the DocStrip style.
%
% A standard package layout might look something like the following.
% \begin{Verbatim}
%  abc/
%      abc.dtx
%      abc.ins
%      build.lua
%      README
%      support/
%      testfiles/
% \end{Verbatim}
% The top level |support/| directory (optional) would contain any necessary files for compiling documentation, running regression tests, and so on.
%
% The \pkg{l3build} system is also capable of building and checking \emph{bundles} or packages or modules.
% For example, within the \LaTeX3 project we have the \textsf{l3packages} bundle which contains the \textsf{xparse}, \textsf{xtemplate}, etc., modules.
% These are all built and distributed as one bundle for installation, distribution \emph{via} CTAN and so forth.
%
% Each module in a bundle will have its own build script, and a bundle build script brings them all together.
% A standard bundle layout would contain the following structure.
% \begin{Verbatim}
% mybundle/
%          build.lua
%          support/
%          yyy/                    zoo/
%              build.lua               build.lua
%              README                  README
%              testfiles/              testfiles/
%              yyy.dtx                 zoo.dtx
%              yyy.ins                 zoo.ins
% \end{Verbatim}
% All modules within a bundle must use the same build script name.
%
% The |testfiles/| folder is local to each module, and its layout consists of a series of regression tests with their outputs.
% \begin{Verbatim}
% testfiles/
%           test1.lvt
%           test1.tlg
%           ...
%           support/
%                   my-test.cls
% \end{Verbatim}
% Again, the |support/| directory contains any files necessary to run some or all of these tests.
%
% When the build system runs, it creates a directory |build/| for various unpacking, compilation, and testing purposes.
% For a module, this build folder can be in the main directory of the package itself, but for a bundle it should be common for the bundle itself and for all modules within that bundle.
% A |build/| folder can be safety deleted; all material within is re-generated for each command of the \pkg{l3build} system.
%
% \section{Main build commands}
%
% In the working directory of this package (|abc/|), the following commands can be executed.
% \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]\ttfamily
% \item check
% \item checklvt \meta{name} [\meta{engine}]
% \item cmdcheck
% \item clean
% \item doc
% \item install
% \item savetlg \meta{name} [\meta{engine}]
% \item unpack
% \end{itemize}
% These commands are described below.
%
% \begin{buildcmd}{check}
% Runs the test suite in directory \var{testdir} (\luavar{testdir}).
% This involves iterating through each \texttt{.lvt} file in the test directory and comparing the output against each matching predefined \texttt{.tlg} file.
%
% If changes to the package or the typesetting environment have affected the results, the check for that file fails.
% A |diff| of the expected to actual output should then be inspected to determine the cause of the error; it is located in the \var{testdir} directory (default \luavar{testdir}).
%
% Checking can be performed with any or all of the `engines' \texttt{pdftex}, \texttt{xetex}, and \texttt{luatex}.
% By default, each test is executed with all three, being compared against the \texttt{.tlg} file produced from the \var{pdftex} engine (these defaults are controlled by the |chkengines| and |stdengine| variable respectively).
% More detail on this in the documentation on |savetlg|.
% Options passed to the binary are defined in the variable \var{checkopts}.
%
% By default, |texmf| trees are searched for input files when checking. This can be disabled by setting \var{checksearch} to |false|: isolation provides confidence that the tests cannot accidentally be running with incorrect files installed in the main distribution or |hometexmf|. 
% \end{buildcmd}
%
%
% \begin{buildcmd}{checklvt \meta{name} [\meta{engine}]}
% Checks only the test \texttt{\meta{name}.lvt} with optionally specified \meta{engine} (one of |pdftex|, |xetex|, or |luatex|).
% If an \meta{engine} is not specified, all three engines are checked (or those defined by the |chkengines| variable if changed from the default).
% \end{buildcmd}
%
% \begin{buildcmd}{cmdcheck}
% For \cls{l3doc}-based sources, allows checking that the commands defined in the code part are documented in the description part.
% This is performed by passing the |check| option to the \cls{l3doc} class, and checking the resultant |.cmds| file.
% \end{buildcmd}
%
%
% \begin{buildcmd}{clean}
% This command removes all temporary files used for package bundling and regression testing.
% In the standard layout, these are all files within the directories defined by \var{localdir}, \var{testdir}, \var{typesetdir} and \var{unpackdir}, as well as all files defined in the \var{cleanfiles} variable.
% (TODO: specify in which directories these files are removed.)
% \end{buildcmd}
%
%
% \begin{buildcmd}{ctan}
% Creates an archive of the package and its documentation, suitable for uploading to CTAN including a |.tds.zip| file containing the `\TeX\ Directory Structure' layout of the package or bundle.
% The archive therefore contains two `views' of the package:
% \begin{Verbatim}
% abc.zip/
%         abc/
%             abc.dtx
%             abc.ins
%             abc.pdf
%             README
%         abc.tds.zip/
%                     doc/latex/abc/
%                                   abc.pdf
%                                   README
%                  source/latex/abc/
%                                   abc.dtx
%                                   abc.ins
%                     tex/latex/abc/
%                                   abc.sty
% \end{Verbatim}
% The files copied into the archive are controlled by a number of variables.
% The `root' of the TDS structure is defined by \var{tdsroot}, which is \luavar{tdsroot} by default. Plain users would redefine this to |"generic"|, for example.
% The |doc| tree is constructed from:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item all files matched by \var{demofiles}, and
% \item all files matched by \var{typesetfiles} with their extension replaced with |.pdf|, and
% \item all files matched by \var{txtfiles}, but when copied their extension is entirely removed (e.g., |README.markdown| is copied as just |README|).
% \end{itemize}
% The |source| tree is constructed from all files matched by \var{typesetfiles} and \var{sourcefiles}.
% The |tex| tree from all files matched by \var{installfiles}.
%
% Files that should always be excluded from the archive are matched against the \var{excludefiles} variable; by default this is \luavar{excludefiles}, which match Emacs' autosave files.
%
% To create the archive, by default the binary \var{zipexe} is used (\luavar{zipexe}) with options \var{zipopts} (|-v -r -X|). The intermediate build directories \var{ctandir} and \var{tdsdir} are used to construct the archive.
% \end{buildcmd}
%
%
% \begin{buildcmd}{doc}
% Compiles all documentation files in the \var{typesetdir} directory.
% If the compilation is successful, auxiliary files defined by the \var{auxfiles} variable are removed, and the |.pdf| is moved back into the main directory.
%
% The documentation compilation is performed with the \var{typesetexe} binary (default \texttt{pdflatex}), with options \var{typesetopts}.
% Files that match |typesetsuppfiles| in the |support| directory (|supportdir|) are copied into the |build/local| directory (|localdir|) for the typesetting compilation process.
% Additional dependencies listed in the \var{typesetdeps} variable (empty by default) will also be installed.
%
% If \var{typesetsearch} is \code{true} (default), standard \texttt{texmf} search trees are used in the typesetting compilation. If set to false, \emph{all} necessary files for compilation must be included in the |build/local| sandbox.
% \end{buildcmd}
%
%
% \begin{buildcmd}{install}
% Copies all package files (defined by \var{installfiles}) into the user's home \texttt{texmf} tree in the form of the \TeX\ Directory Structure.
% \end{buildcmd}
%
%
% \begin{buildcmd}{savetlg \meta{name} [\meta{engine}]}
% This command runs through the same execution as |checklvt| for a specific test \texttt{\meta{name}.lvt} with optional \texttt{\meta{engine}}.
% If no \meta{engine} is specific, this command saves the output of the test to a |.tlg| file.
% This file is then used in all subsequent checks against the \texttt{\meta{name}.lvt} test.
%
% If the \meta{engine} is specified (one of |pdftex|, |xetex|, or |luatex|), the saved output is stored in \texttt{\meta{name}.\meta{engine}.tlg}. This is necessary if running the test through a different engine produces a different output.
% A normalisation process is performed when checking to avoid common differences such as register allocation; full details are listed in section~\ref{sec:norm}.
% \end{buildcmd}
%
%
% \begin{buildcmd}{unpack}
% Unpacks all files into the directory defined by \var{unpackdir}. This occurs before other build commands such as |doc|, |check|, etc., and should usually not be necessary to perform on its own (except for testing).
%
% The unpacking process is performed by executing the \var{unpackexe} (default \texttt{tex}) with options \var{unpackopts} on all files defined by the \var{unpackfiles} variable; by default, all files that match \luavar{unpackfiles}.
%
% If additional support files are required for the unpacking process, these can be enumerated in the \var{unpacksuppfiles} variable.
%
% By default this process allows files to be accessed in all standard |texmf| trees; this can be disabled by setting \var{unpacksearch} to |false|.
% \end{buildcmd}
%
% \section{Example build scripts}
%
% An example of a standalone build script for a package that uses self-contained |.dtx| files is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:breqn}.
% Here, the |module| only is defined, and since it doesn't use |.ins| files so the variable \var{unpackfiles} is redefined to run |tex| on the |.dtx| files instead to generate the necessary |.sty| files.
% There are some PDFs in the repository that shouldn't be part of a CTAN submission, so they're explicitly excluded, and here unpacking is done `quietly' to minimise console output when building the package.
% Finally, because this is a standalone package, we assume that \pkg{l3build} is installed in the main \TeX{} distribution and find the Lua script by searching for it.
%

%
% An example of a bundle build script for \pkg{l3packages} is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:bundle}.
% Note for \LaTeX3 we use a common file to set all build variables in one place, and the path to the |l3build.lua| script is hard-coded so we always use our own most recent version of the script.
% An example of an accompanying module build script is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:module}.

% Under a Unix-like platform, you may wish to run `|chmod +x build.lua|' on these files, which allows a simpler command line use. Instead of writing\\

% \section{Variables}
%
% This section lists all variables defined in the |l3build.lua| script that are available for customisation.
%
% \luavartypeset
%
% \section{Dependencies}
%
% If you have multiple packages that are developed separately but still interact in some way, it's often desirable to integrate them when performing regression tests.
% For \LaTeX3, for example, when we make changes to \pkg{l3kernel} it's important to check that the tests for \pkg{l3packages} still run correctly, so it's necessary to include the \pkg{l3kernel} files in the build process for \pkg{l3packages}.
%
% In other words, \pkg{l3packages} is \emph{dependent} on \pkg{l3kernel}, and this is specified in \pkg{l3build} by setting appropriately the variables \texttt{checkdeps}, \texttt{typesetdeps}, and \texttt{unpackdeps}.
% The relevant parts of the \LaTeX3 repository is structured as the following.
% \begin{Verbatim}
% l3/
%    l3kernel/
%               build.lua
%               expl3.dtx
%               expl3.ins
%               ...
%               testfiles/
%    l3packages/
%               build.lua
%               xparse/
%                      build.lua
%                      testfiles/

%                      xparse.ins
%    support/
% \end{Verbatim}
% For \LaTeX3 build files, |maindir| is defined as top level folder |l3|, so all build and support files are located here.
% To set \pkg{l3kernel} as a dependency of \pkg{l3package}, within |l3packages/xparse/build.lua| the equivalent of the following is set:
% \begin{Verbatim}
%   maindir = "../.."
%   checkdeps = {maindir .. "/l3kernel"}
% \end{Verbatim}
% This ensures that the \pkg{l3kernel} code is included in all processes involved in unpacking and checking and so on.
% The name of the script file in the dependency is set with the |scriptname| variable; by default these are |"build.lua"|.
%
%
% \section{Output normalisation}
% \label{sec:norm}
%
% To allow test files to be used between different systems (\emph{e.g.}~when
% multiple developers are involved in a project), the log files are normalised
% before comparison during checking. This removes some system-dependent
% data but also some variations due to different engines and bugs in some
% versions of some engines. This normalisation consists of two parts: removing
% (\enquote{ignoring}) some lines and modifying others to give consistent
% test. Currently, the following types of line are ignored:
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item Lines before the \cs{START}, after the \cs{END} and within
%     \cs{OMIT}/\cs{TIMO} blocks
%   \item Entirely blank lines, including those consisting only of spaces.
%   \item Lines containing file dates in the
%    \texttt{\meta{yyyy}/\meta{mm}/\meta{dd}} format.
%  \item Lines starting \cs{openin} or \cs{openout}.
%  \item \LuaTeX{}-specific lines in box output for the \cs{local\ldots}
%    concepts it introduces when these are set to their defaults.
%  \item \LuaTeX{}-specific lines in box output which record
%    \cs{discretionary}.
% \end{itemize}
% Modifications made in lines are:
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item Removal of the name of the test file itself.
%   \item Removal spaces at the start of lines (deals with some issues
%     with \LuaTeX{} using a different amount of indentation to other engines).
%   \item Removal of |./| at start of file names.
%   \item Standardisation of the list of units known to \TeX{} (\pdfTeX{}
%     and \LuaTeX{} add a small number of additional units which are not
%     known to \XeTeX{}).
%   \item Standardisation of \verb*|\csname\endcsname | to |\csname\endcsname|
%     (the former is formally correct, but the latter was produced for many
%     years due to a \TeX{} bug).
%   \item Conversion of \texttt{on line \meta{number}} to \texttt{on line ...}
%     to allow flexibility in changes to test files.
%   \item Restriction of glue set in boxes to four decimal places (\LuaTeX{}
%     may vary in the last digit from the \pdfTeX{} values).
%   \item Removal of the Omega-like \texttt{direction TLT} added by
%     \LuaTeX{} to boxes running in the \enquote{normal} way.
%   \item Conversion of low chars ($1$ to $31$) to |^^| notation (\LuaTeX{}
%     does not do this).
%   \item Correction of a \LuaTeX{} error message typo (|I''m going to assume|).
% \end{itemize}
%
% \section{Commands for test files}
%
% Test files are written in a \TeX{} dialect using the support file |regression-test.tex|, which should be |\input| at the very beginning of each test.
% The macros loaded by this file sett up the test system and provide a number of commands to aid the production of a structured test suite.
% The basis of the test suite is to output material into the |.log| file, from which a normalised test output (|.tlg|) file is produced by the build command |savetlg|.
% A number of commands are provided for this; they are all written in uppercase to help avoid possible conflicts with other package commands.
%
% \cs{TYPE} is used to write material to the \texttt{.log} file, like \LaTeX's \cs{typeout}, but it allows `long' input.
%
% A variety of commands, following, use \cs{TYPE} to output strings to the \texttt{.log} file.
% \begin{itemize}
% \item
% \cs{SEPARATOR} inserts a long line of \texttt{=} symbols to break up the log output.
% \item
% \cs{NEWLINE} inserts a linebreak into the log file.
% \item
% \cs{TRUE}, \cs{FALSE}, \cs{YES}, \cs{NO} output those strings to the log file.
% \item
% \cs{ERROR} is not defined but is commonly used to indicate a code path that should never be reached.
% \item
% The \cs{TEST}\marg{title}\marg{contents} command surrounds its \meta{contents} with some \cs{SEPARATOR}s and a \meta{title}.
% \item
% \cs{TESTEXP} surrounds its contents with \cs{TYPE} and formatting to match \cs{TEST}; this can be used as a shorthand to test expandable commands.
% \item
% TODO: would a \cs{TESTREXP} command be useful as well?
% \end{itemize}
%
% An example of some of these commands is shown following.
% \begin{Verbatim}
% \begin{TEST}{bool_set, lazy evaluation}
%   \bool_set:Nn \l_tmpa_bool
%    {
%     \int_compare_p:nNn 1=1
%     && \bool_if_p:n
%      {
%       \int_compare_p:nNn 2=3 ||
%       \int_compare_p:nNn 4=4 ||
%       \int_compare_p:nNn 1=\ERROR % is skipped
%      }
%     && \int_compare_p:nNn 2=2
%    }
%   \bool_if:NTF \l_tmpa_bool \TRUE \FALSE
% \end{TEST}
% \end{Verbatim}
% This test will produce the following in the output.
% \begin{Verbatim}
% ==========================================
% TEST 8: bool_set, lazy evaluation
% ==========================================
% TRUE
% ==========================================
% \end{Verbatim}
% (Only if it's the eighth test in the file of course.)
%
% \subsection{Showing box content}
%
% The commands introduced above are only useful for checking algorithmic or logical correctness.
% Many packages should be tested based on their typeset output instead; \TeX{} provides a mechanism for this by printing the contents of a box to the log file.
% The |regression-test.tex| driver file sets up the relevant \TeX{} parameters to produce as much output as possible when showing box output.
%
% A plain \TeX{} example of showing box content follows.
% \begin{Verbatim}[frame=single,fontsize=\small]
% \input regression-test.tex\relax
% \START
% \setbox0=\hbox{\rm hello \it world $a=b+c$}
% \showbox0
% \END
% \end{Verbatim}
% This produces the output shown in Figure~\ref{fig:box-plain}.
% It is clear that if the definitions used to typeset the material in the box changes, the log output will differ and the test will no longer pass.
%
% The equivalent test in \LaTeXe{} using \pkg{l3kernel} is similar.
% \begin{Verbatim}[frame=single,fontsize=\small]
% \input{regression-test.tex}
% \documentclass{article}
% \usepackage{expl3}
% \START
% \ExplSyntaxOn
% \box_new:N \l_tmp_box
% \hbox_set:Nn \l_tmp_box {hello~ \emph{world}~ $a=b+c$}
% \box_show:N \l_tmp_box
% \ExplSyntaxOff
% \END
% \end{Verbatim}
% The output from this test is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:box-expl}.
%
% When examples are not self-contained enough to be typeset into boxes, it is possible to ask \TeX{} to output the entire contents of a page.
% Insert \cs{showoutput} for \LaTeX{} or set \cs{tracingoutput} positive for plain \TeX{}; ensure that the test ends with \cs{newpage} or equivalent because \TeX{} waits until the entire page is finished before outputting it.
%
% TODO: should we add something like \cs{TRACEPAGES} to be format-agnostic here? Should this perhaps even be active by default?
