# This workflow makes sure that there is always a cache present for the main branch.
# This cache can be picked up by all other branches, so it ensures that even new
# branches and tags don't have to download a complete copy of TeX Live.
#
# Since GitHub keeps unused caches for one week, we need to run at least once a week
# to ensure that the cache always stays around. To avoid timing issues and issues
# when an update fails for some reason, we run twice per week.
