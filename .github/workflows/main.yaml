# Currently we run in two situations:
on:
  # Whenever someone pushes to a branch in our repo
  push:
    branches:
      - "**"
  # Whenever a pull request is opened, reopened or gets new commits.
  pull_request:
# This implies that for every push to a local branch in our repo for which a
# pull request is open this runs twice. But it's important to ensure that pull
# requests get tested even if their branch comes from a fork.

jobs:
  # The l3build job contains the actual work. We misuse the matrix mechanism to
  # create three jobs which only differ in minimal elements.
  # For tags we do not run this since we run the release job instead.

        # IMPORTANT: target == 'doc' is used as a trigger to
