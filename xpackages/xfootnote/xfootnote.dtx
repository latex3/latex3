% \begin{abstract}
%   This is the first attempt on setting up templates for (foot)note
%   handling. It uses template names like `notemark' and `notetext'
%   with the intention of supporting not only footnotes but at a later
%   stage endnotes and perhaps special notes lie footnotes placed into
%   the margin.
%
%   It does necessarily need to interface to a pagesetup
%   handling. Right now this is only provided to support what it
%   available in the implemented cases and needs a complete redesign
%   later on --- thus that part should definitely not be taken
%   seriously.
%
%   Similarly the `notearea' concept is probably not really
%   appropriate and might vanish once there is a better interface to
%   pagesetup (or somebody has a good idea how to handle this
%   differently).
%
%   The code heavily borrows from various sources, e.g., the \LaTeXe{}
%   kernel, Robin's \texttt{footmisc} package and perhaps other places
%   i've forgotten. Still far more borrowing is needed, in particular
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item support for page-numbered notes
%   \item support for layouts like \texttt{ftnright}
%   \item \ldots
%   \end{itemize}
% \end{abstract}
%
% \section{Interfaces}
%
% \begin{TemplateInterfaceDescription}{notemark}
%
%   \TemplateArgument{1}
%       {Boolean valued. True signals that this mark is immediately followed
%        by another mark and both marks should be typographically combined.}
%
%   \TemplateArgument{2}
%       {Number to generate the mark from or \NoValue{} in which case
%       the mark is generated from the value of an internal counter
%       (this counter is first incremented)}
%
%   \TemplateSemantics
%
%   The first argument is used to signal that several marks appear in
%   succession and should be typographically combined, e.g., by
%   separating them with a comma.
%
%   The second argument is normally \NoValue{} in which case the
%   correct mark is generated by the template. The counter to use for
%   this case is specified in the template attributes. Note that it is
%   the task of the template in increment this counter prior to using
%   it. The corresponding `notetext' template uses the counter value
%   without any modification.
%
%   The name of the internal counter must be settable in every
%   template instance, the suggested key name is `counter-id'.
%
%   If the second argument is a number it is locally assigned to the
%   internal counter and the mark is generated by using this value.
%   Unfortunately the current implementation does not allow to provide
%   such number indirectly, e.g., via a |\label| |\ref| mechanism.  A
%   feature like this could be handy especially in texts where several
%   marks are supposed to refer to the same note
%   text.\footnote{Provide?}
%
%
% \end{TemplateInterfaceDescription}
%
%
%
% \begin{TemplateDescription}{notemark}{std}
%
%   \TemplateKey{counter-id}{n}
%      {Name of \LaTeX{} counter to use for mark generation}
%      {footnote}
%
%   \TemplateKey{mark-format}{f1}
%      {Function that formats the generated mark}
%      {make superscript}
%
%   \TemplateKey{multi-mark-sep}{f0}
%      {Function that provides any necessary separation between two
%       successive marks}
%      {comma with negative kern (1pt) before}
%
%   \TemplateSemantics
%   I think that this is essentially all that is needed to produce all
%   common and not so common layouts for marks. Perhaps one might want
%   to add a few bells and whistles to the `mark-format' (like a
%   `mark-font') to be more consistent with other templates but for
%   now i don't see anything that is really needed.
%
% \end{TemplateDescription}
%
%
%
%
%
% \begin{TemplateInterfaceDescription}{notetext}
%
%   \TemplateArgument{1}
%       {Number to generate the mark in front of the text or
%       \NoValue{} in which case
%       the mark is generated from the current value of an internal
%       counter (this counter is not modified)}
%
%   \TemplateArgument{2}
%       {The text of the note}
%
%   \TemplateSemantics
%   The usage of the first argument corresponds to the second argument
%   of the `notemark' type with the exception that the internal
%   counter is not modified but only used.
%
%   The name of the internal counter must be settable in every
%   template instance, the suggested key name is `counter-id'.
%
%   The second argument is allowed to consist of multiple paragraphs.
%
%   A template of type `notetext' typesets the note text and the mark
%   into `note area' for deferred placement in the document, e.g., on
%   the bottom of the page or at the end of the chapter, etc.
%
%   The reference to this `note area' must be settable by every
%   template; the
%   suggested  key name is `area-id'.
%
%   The retrieval from that `note area' is done by a `notearea'
%   template instance.\footnote{If external storage, i.e., files are
%   used, as typically in the case of endnote typesetting, it should
%   be considered to use a different template type for retrieval and
%   it should also be considered to use a different mechanism to
%   specify this area (i.e., not the direct reference to a set of
%   insertion registers.}
%
% \end{TemplateInterfaceDescription}
%
%
%
% \begin{TemplateDescription}{notetext}{std}
%
%   \TemplateKey{area-id}{n}
%      {Name of the area to place notes into (an insertion register)}
%      {footins}
%
%   \TemplateKey{counter-id}{n}
%      {Name of \LaTeX{} counter to use for mark generation}
%      {footnote}
%
%   \TemplateKey{mark-format}{f1}
%      {Function that formats the mark}
%      {make superscript}
%
%   \TemplateKey{headed-para-setup}{i headedpara}
%      {Instance that defines relationship between a paragraph text
%      and its `heading' (which is the formatted mark in this case)}
%      {}
%
%   \TemplateSemantics
%
%   Formats the note text as a paragraph (or several) with the note
%   marker done as a `heading' to the first paragraph. This allows for
%   most if not all formats that treat such text as individual
%   paragraphs.
%
%   The `area-id' should match the one used in the corresponding
%   instance of the `notearea template.
%
%   The `counter-id' should match the one used in the corresponding
%   instance of the `notemark' template.
%
%   The `mark-format' key is independent of the corresponding key in
%   the `note-mark' template since it is quite common to format the
%   marks differently in main text and in the note text.
%
%   This template does miss a lot of necessary keys such as the h\&j
%   setup for the paragraph text, font setup, and, and, and. Most of
%   this is currently hardwired. --- New implementation needed.
%
% \end{TemplateDescription}
%
%
%
%
% \begin{TemplateDescription}{notetext}{para}
%
%   \TemplateKey{area-id}{n}

%      {What to do if note text contains \texttt{\textbackslash par}
%       commands}
%      {a paragraph sign separated by word space}
%
%   \TemplateSemantics
%
%   Prepares for formatting all notes in the note area as a single
%   paragraph. The formatting is actually split between this template
%   and the `notearea' template with the same name, i.e., those two
%   need to be selected together.
%
%   A design with running notes is suitable for documents with many
%   and typically short notes. It is badly suited to handle
%   multi-paragraphed notes. For this reason the template provides an
%   action key to specify what should happen if a |\par| command is
%   encountered in the note text. Technically starting a new paragraph
%   would difficult (if not impossible) and anyway is not a suitable
%   solution for that particular design. So the alternatives are,
%   signalling an error\footnote{Perhaps this should be the default!}
%   or signalling the start of a new paragraph by other typographical
%   means such as a paragraph sign or a bullet.
%
%   The `area-id' should match the one used in the corresponding
%   instance of the `notearea template.
%
%   The `counter-id' should match the one used in the corresponding
%   instance of the `notemark' template.
%
%   The `mark-format' key is independent of the corresponding key in
%   the `note-mark' template since it is quite common to format the
%   marks differently in main text and in the note text.

%
%
% \begin{TemplateInterfaceDescription}{notearea}
%
%   \TemplateArgument{none}
%       {---}
%
%   \TemplateSemantics
%
%   Formats the contents of the `note area' by attaching things like a
%   rule, setting the overall color, etc. The typesetting of the
%   individual notes has happened earlier via the `notetext' template;
%   however it is permissible that the formatting is shared between
%   that template and templates of the current type (this may be
%   needed if the formatting depends on having all notes available,
%   e.g., in the case of templates that format all notes into a single
%   paragraph).
%
%   The reference to this `note area' must be settable by every
%   template; the suggested key name is `area-id'.

%      {In what color do we set these notes?}
%      {\texttt{\textbackslash normalcolor}}
%
%   \TemplateSemantics
%    Typeset the collected notes. It misses several keys that needs to
%    be added at some point. For example, the footnote rule would be
%    an obvious candidate, except that i couldn't make up my mind how
%    to code this yet.

%
% \section{Dependencies}
%
% The templates provided by this package are closely related, thus
% choosing one to build an instance may have some influence on
% remaining choices for other templates.
% These dependencies are as follows:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item
%   The internal counter specified by a `notemark' instance should be
%   the same as the one specified by the corresponding `notetext'
%   instance. Of course, if a document class provides more than one
%   type of notes, e.g., footnotes as well as endnotes, then the
%   instances for the different type of notes will typically
%   \emph{not} share a counter name.
% \item
%   The `note area' filled by the `notetext' template has to be the
%   same as the one retrieved by the `notearea' template for
%   corresponding notes.
% \item
%   Furthermore in some cases selecting a `notetext' template requires
%   the selection of a particular `notearea' template as the
%   formatting of the notes is actually split across the two templates.
% \item
%   The name of the `note area' refers to an insertion register which
%   at the current moment has to be provided externally, i.e., via
%   |\newinsert|. Some of the values for this insertion register,
%   e.g., the |\skip| part have to be externally set as well --- this
%   should change!
% \item
%   \ldots
% \end{itemize}
%
%
% \section{Interfaces that should go in other modules}
%
%
% \begin{TemplateInterfaceDescription}{pagesetup}
%
%   \TemplateArgument{none}
%       {---}
%
%   \TemplateSemantics
%   This template type sets up the characteristics of a page. It
%   defines the various text areas their relation to each other, as
%   well as other information that is relevant for page makeup. What
%   in the end is required to be set by this template remains to be
%   seen.
%
%   As of today the only thing this template actually does is handling
%   footnote-related issues. It does most certainly need a completely
%   different implementation which --- once ready --- will certainly
%   have some influence on the way the note templates are defined.
%
% \end{TemplateInterfaceDescription}
%

%
%   \TemplateKey{footnote-bottom-boolean}{s}
%      {Should footnotes appear at the bottom of page even if page
%      isn't full? (false means place footnotes directly below text)}
%      {false}
%
%   \TemplateKey{footnote-area-setup}{i notearea}

%      {}
%
%   \TemplateSemantics
%   As far as footnote-handling is concerned (and that is all what the
%   template currently does) it provides a footnote area below the
%   main text area, i.e., same thing as current \LaTeXe.

%
%   \TemplateArgument{1}
%       {Lemma}

%
%   \TemplateSemantics
%    Formats `Lemma' and `Remaining text' as a single paragraph with
%    some special handling for `Lemma; (e.g., some special font, or
%    other embellishment). It should be considered if such a template
%    would better take three arguments as often the `Lemma' has a
%    structure like `Number' + `Heading'.

%      {}
%
%   \TemplateSemantics
%    This is a very simple template; it doesn't even define how to set
%    the h\&j of the paragraph. I've ignored that part deliberately
%    until after we have the galley mechanism available which allows
%    to specify those issues with more ease.
%
% \end{TemplateDescription}
%
%
%
% \section{Open problems}
%
% \begin{itemize}
% \item The handling of the notearea is rather bad. First of all there
%   is no decent setup possibility yet for the insertion register
%   values, e.g., the |\skip| but also others.
% \item There is no natural way yet to integrate endnotes into this
%   concept (other than nevertheless setting up an insertion register
%   for them).
% \item All that and a few other things i've forgotten at the moment
%   suggest that this need some changes in the design!
% \item Most of the above templates could do with some further
%   generalisation.
% \item
%   Templates for endnotes need to written
% \item
%   Other interesting page setup templates should be provided, e.g.,
%   integration of the \texttt{ftnright} package, footnotes placed in
%   the margin, etc.
% \item
%   None of the templates set up the paragraph handling via
%   \texttt{hj} templates (hyphenation \& justification) which they
%   eventually will, because the h\&j templates make use of the new
%   galley mechanism which is not finished.
% \end{itemize}

% \subsection{The \texttt{para} option code}
%
% [all stolen]
%
% The basis of the code for this option comes from \TeX{}book, p.398
% ff.~(``Dirty Tricks''), though it does (of course) avoid
% redefining |\\| which has some other (somewhat significant) uses in
% \LaTeX{}!  The user should be aware of
% Knuth's note on the limitations of this method of doing the job: the
% \TeX{} stack is used four times per footnote, and the stack is
% limited (see the \TeX{}book, p.300 ff.).  If you have very large
% numbers of footnotes (in the hundreds), and encounter the error
% ``|! TeX capacity exceeded, sorry (... save size ...)|'', you may
% need to break your text into smaller sections and compile the
% separately.  Fortunately (say the comments on the original
% |fnpara.sty|) this is very easy to do with \LaTeX{}, provided that
% you reset the footnote counter to make the joins seamless.
%
% First we define a means of hiding |\par| in a case where we need it
% within the declaration of the |para| option
%
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\FN@unhbox@par#1{\unhbox#1\par}
%    \end{macrocode}
%
% We need some temporary boxes, and \LaTeX{} only defines one
%
%    \begin{macrocode}
\let\FN@tempboxa\@tempboxa
\newbox\FN@tempboxb
\newbox\FN@tempboxc
%    \end{macrocode}
%
% Another direct crib from the \TeX{}book:
%
%    \begin{macrocode}
  \newskip\footglue \footglue=1em plus.3em minus.3em
%    \end{macrocode}
%
% The standard classes set the footnote mark flush with the text of
% the footnote, but that's not appropriate for paragraph footnotes, we
% find.
%
% We need to record a value for the baseline skip when in footnotes:
%
%    \begin{macrocode}
{\footnotesize \newdimen\footnotebaselineskip
  \global
  \footnotebaselineskip=\normalbaselineskip}
%    \end{macrocode}
%
%
% Now we derive a fudge factor from the baselineskip we've just
% established\footnote{We use \cs{strip@pt} which is defined for use
% in the \LaTeXe{} kernel, but not documented: this is a potential
% problem, but I don't imagine it will be, since the definition is
% obviously \emph{right}}:
%
%    \begin{macrocode}
\@tempdima=\footnotebaselineskip \multiply\@tempdima by 1024
\divide \@tempdima by \columnwidth \multiply\@tempdima by 64
\xdef\fudgefactor{\strip@pt\@tempdima }
%    \end{macrocode}
%
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\makefootnoteparagraph #1 {\unvbox #1 \makehboxofhboxes
  \setbox\FN@tempboxa=\hbox{\unhbox\FN@tempboxa \removehboxes}
%    \end{macrocode}
%CCCC  ---now we are ready to set the paragraph:
%    \begin{macrocode}
    \hsize\columnwidth
    \@parboxrestore
    \baselineskip=\footnotebaselineskip
    \noindent
%    \end{macrocode}
%CCCC ---this is where the strut is needed:
%    \begin{macrocode}
  \rule{\z@}{\footnotesep}%
  \FN@unhbox@par{\FN@tempboxa}
}
\def\makehboxofhboxes{\setbox\FN@tempboxa=\hbox{}
  \loop\setbox\FN@tempboxb=\lastbox \ifhbox\FN@tempboxb
  \setbox\FN@tempboxa=\hbox{\box\FN@tempboxb\unhbox\FN@tempboxa}\repeat}
