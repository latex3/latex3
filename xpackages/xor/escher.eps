% Thickness parameter:
% /Thick is the thickness of the structural members of the triange,
% as a fraction of the height of the triangle.
% Reasonable looking impossible triangles can be obtained with Thick <= 1/6.
% right at /Thick == 1/6, there is no space left inside the triangle.
% /Thick > 1/6 yields bizarre, but not very interesting results.
% /Thick < 1/20 is less interesting, because the "impossibility"
% is not so striking when the structural members are that thin.
% A good "standard" value is 1/8.
