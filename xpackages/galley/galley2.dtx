%   This module provides the data structure for galleys and contains
%   the low-level interfaces for direct manipulation of this data structure.
%   Higher-level templates for interfacing with the
%   galley mechanism are set up by the module
%   \texttt{xhj}.
%   The low-level interfaces of the current module are  geared
%   towards package writers having special needs which are not
%   fulfilled by the templates in the \texttt{xhj} module.
%   They are not intended to be used directly in class design.

% \section{Introduction}
%
% In \LaTeXplus{} terminology a galley is a rectangular area which
% receives text and other material filling it from
% top.\footnote{The predominant direction depends on the writing
% system and with extensions to \TeX{} such as Omega there are
% possibilities to define galleys with a different filling direction.}
% The vertically extend of a galley is normally not restricted
% (there are exceptions); instead certain chunks are taken off the top
% of an
% already partially filled galley to form columns or similar areas
% on a page. This process is typically asynchronous but there are ways
% to control or change its behavior.
%
% Examples for galleys are `the main galley', where the continuous
% document data gets formatted into  and from which columns and pages are
% constructed, and  `vbox galley's, such as the body of  a minipage
% environment or the body of a float (in \LaTeXe only---the new float
% mechanism for \LaTeXplus{} will employ horizontally oriented float
% bodies). The latter galleys are typically not being split after
% formatting though there can be exceptions.
%
% The data that is being formatted into a galley can be described as a
% sequence of paragraphs of text separated by vertical material such
% as vertical spaces, penalties, writes, specials, etc.
%
% There are two components that a mechanism for galleys has to provide:
% the framework for manipulating the shape and placement of paragraph
% text (this is provided with higher-level templates in the module
% \texttt{xhj}) and the framework for manipulating the inter-paragraph
% material.
%
%
%
% \subsection{Some problems with \LaTeXe{} galleys}
%
% The handling of inter-paragraph material poses the most difficult
% problems as it is typically influenced by various factors and
% information gained at different stages throughout the document
% processing. \LaTeXe{} provided a certain control over this material,
% e.g., headings would set a |@nobreak| flag to prevent paragraph
% breaking after them and other commands and environments would test
% for it; |\addvspace| and |\addpenalty| could be used several times
% in succession and still provide reasonable results, but all in all
% these have been adhoc solutions to the most pressing problem of that
% area---many others remained unsolved:
%
% The following is a list of document extracts which one can imagine
% to appear in ordinary documents. They all have in common that in
% \LaTeXe{} they produce surprising (and undesired) results:
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item
% \begin{verbatim}
% \end{itemize} \vspace{3pt} \begin{itemize} ...
%\end{verbatim}
% \ldots not three points of extra space but 13 (with
%       the \texttt{article} class)
%
% \item
% \begin{verbatim}
% \section{HEAD} {\sc ABC} ...
%\end{verbatim}
% \ldots page breaking restrictions apply to the
%       second paragraph after the heading not the first as they
%       should
% \item
% \begin{verbatim}
% \usepackage{hyperref}
%\end{verbatim}
% \ldots the danger of completely changed vertical spacing because
%       the |\special|s added by \texttt{hyperref} interfere with the
%       spacing and penalty mechanisms of \LaTeXe
%
%
% \item
% \begin{verbatim}
% {\section{HEAD}} para text \par \begin{itemize} ...
%\end{verbatim}
%   \ldots one gets an indentation after the heading; a page break might
%   happen after the first line in the paragraphs; and there will be no
%   space above the itemize environment (though there will be space
%   below) --- because of this \LaTeXe{} claims this is incorrect input
%   --- and then since \LaTeX\,2.09 uses the equivalent of
%   |\twocolumn[\chapter{HEAD}]| in certain circumstances in the report
%   and book class :-)
% \end{enumerate}
%
% All these pitfalls are due to the fact that \LaTeXe{} typesets the
% inter-paragraph material whenever it receives it and once it is
% typeset \TeX{} has only a limited power to modify the material
% already present on the galley.
%
% Thus to be able to do better one has to defer any typesetting until
% the very last moment (i.e., when the next paragraph starts) and
% instead collect such inter-paragraph material in a suitable data
% structure where it can be manipulated and examined.
% The present code in this module provides such a data structure. Of
% course, to be successful it is important that all functions that
% would normally produce inter-paragraph material (such as user
% commands like |\vspace|) obey the concepts behind the mechanism and
% refrain from directly adding to the galley.
% How this is achieved will be explained in the next sections.
%
%
% \section{The galley data structure}
%
% A galley is a \LaTeX{} object which contains (or receives)
% paragraphs and typesets them vertically below each other intermixed
% with material like vertical spaces and penalties, etc.\ which are
% placed between such paragraphs.
%
% Galleys can be nested and thus data structures associated with them
% need to be provided using a stack structure.
%
% Technical aspects of the implementation of this structure are
% discussed in section~\ref{sec:galley-concept-impl}.
%
%
% \subsection{Writes, marks, specials and inserts}
%
% Writes, marks, specials and inserts are internally represented by
% \TeX{} as invisible objects (nodes) within the horizontal or
% vertical lists of \TeX. The
% problem with this is that they interfere with other nodes, produce
% additional break points, etc.
%
% For this reason they should not appear on their own but need to be
% placed into precisely controlled places. They can either go directly
% after the last line of a paragraph (preceded and followed by
% |\nobreak|) or they can go directly in front of the next
% paragraph. Table~\ref{tab:vthing} lists the different nodes and
% their suggested handling.
% \begin{table}
% \begin{center}
% \begin{tabular}{ll}
% \hline
%   vthing & attach to \\
% \hline
%   insert & prev \\
%   write  & prev or next (flag) \\
%   mark   & prev or next (flag) \\
%   special (hyperref) & prev or next (different command) \\
%   special (others)   & next
% \end{tabular}
% \end{center}
% \small            ^^A well designed object :-)
% \begin{quote}
%   prev := just add to MVL followed by |\nobreak| \\
%   next := store tokens and put in a primitive ``in hmode at start of
%    next para''
% \end{quote}
% \caption{Invisible nodes and their handling}\label{tab:vthing}
% \end{table}
%
%
% \subsection{Individual parameters}
%
% Each parameter related to a galley exists in two incarnation:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item it has one value which is considered to be static for a
%   sequence of paragraphs (potentially for all paragraphs typeset on
%   this level); any change to it via some mutator command will
%   persist until a further change or the end of the level --- called
%   static galley parameter value (SGPV)
% \item it has one value which is reset after each use to the
%   corresponding static value --- called dynamic galley parameter
%   value (DGPV).
% \end{itemize}
%
% The actual processing routines always use the DGPVs. Thus to produce
% a paragraph sequence with a certain uniform setting of parameters
% one would set up (or modify) the SGPVs, and to locally overwrite
% individual values for one paragraph one would modify the relevant DGPVs.
%
%
% \subsubsection{Vertical (pre-paragraph) parameters}
%
% \begin{description}
% \item[nobreak flag (b)] a flag that signals how page breaking should
%   be handled
%   between the previous and the upcoming paragraph; it takes a number
%   between 0 and 3 with the following meaning: 0 means normal
%   breaking behavior (value of \PARM{penalty} is used), 1 means
%   prevent break between paragraphs (value of \PARM{penalty} is
%   discarded and replaced by 10000), 2 is like 1 but additionally
%   prevents\footnote{as far as possible with \TeX} a page break
%   within the first lines of the upcoming paragraph (by fiddling with
%   |\clubpenalty|), 3 is like 1 but also suppresses a page break for
%   the whole upcoming paragraph (by setting
%   |\interlinepenalty|)\footnote{One can actually implement something
%   even better: with e\TeX{} more control is possible and with normal
%   \TeX{} one could prevent a break for a minimum of X lines by
%   checking on the value of \texttt{\textbackslash prevgraf} and decreasing this for the next
%   time around}
%   At the moment it also supports negative numbers ($-3$ especially)
%   which have the same meaning as the positive counterparts except
%   that they only influence the breaking within the paragraph, e.g.,
%   $-3$ do not break within the next paragraph (which is useful for
%   initials etc). However this should probably be redesigned properly!
% \item[vpenalty (p)] penalty between paragraphs unless flag above is set
% \item[vspace (v)]   skip between paragraphs as set by class or package
%   commands, if -1sp then |\parskip| is used instead.\footnote{This
%   -1sp is a speedup measure to avoid the need for an additional flag
%   for suppressing or adding \texttt{\textbackslash parskip}, this way
%   between normal paragraphs  \texttt{\textbackslash parskip} is
%   added (as the default for this parameter is -1sp) but any setting
%   will result in suppressing it. Of course this means if some
%   environment requests some space it does get 1sp less, acceptable?
%   Using 0pt instead is not a good idea as it makes it difficult to
%   state for some environment that all space should be suppressed.}
% \item[user vpenalty (up)] penalty between paragraphs set by user level
%   commands
% \item[user vspace (uv)] additional space between paragraphs set by user level
%   commands. This space is always added and never suppressed or subject
%   to functions like using the maximum, since it is provided by
%   user commands like |\vspace| where we assume that the user intends
%   to correct the default result.
% \item[prev whatsits (pw)] whatsits that are supposed to get attached to
%   the previous paragraph
% \item[parshape (ps)] structured parameter that sets up a \TeX{}
%   |\parshape| declaration or empty; it replaces the next two parameters
%   in the current implementation. However for reasons of secure
%   programming it might be necessary to have all three. (Right now
%   |\linewidth| and |\@totalleftmargin| are locally set when
%   modifying the ps parameter and thus are in danger of getting out
%   of sync if setting happens not at group boundaries.
% \item[measure (m)] nominal width of the upcoming paragraph lines
%   (|\linewidth| is  set to this value)\footnote{Not used right now
%   see comment on ps parameter.}
% \item[hoffset (h)] offset for the upcoming paragraph lines from the left
%   margin (in \LaTeXe{} this was
%   |\@totalleftmargin|).\footnote{Not used right now, see comment on
%   ps parameter above.}
% \end{description}
%
%
% \subsubsection{Paragraph-start parameters}
%
% \begin{description}
% \item[indentation (i)] flag to suppress insertion of indentation
%    box. A value of 0 means insert indentation any other value suppresses
%    indentation.
% \item[next whatsits (nw)] whatsits that are supposed to get attached to
%   the next paragraph
% \item[object (o)]  typeset material at the start of the paragraph
% \item[queries (q)] information about previously seen objects/states
%   on the galley that can be queried by following code as necessary,
%   e.g., the fact that we just have processed an `item', or a
%   `heading', or \ldots
%
%   This parameter is not yet properly used and perhaps becomes
%   obsolete once there is a proper mechanism for handing such data.
% \end{description}
%
%
% \subsubsection{Paragraph-justification parameters}
%
% The following parameter is supposed to define the inner shape of a
% paragraph, e.g., adjusted, centered lines, ragged shapes, etc. It
% is not meant to define the measure (for this see the \PARM{parshape}).
% \begin{description}
% \item[justification (j)] This is a multivalued parameter consisting of
%      \begin{itemize}
%        \item the counterpart to |\parfillskip| at the
%              beginning of a paragraph
%        \item the \TeX{} |\leftskip|
%        \item the \TeX{} |\rightskip|
%        \item the \TeX{} |\parfillskip|
%        \item the \TeX{} |\spaceskip|
%        \item the \TeX{} |\xspaceskip|
%        \item glue specification to be put in front of a forced ``newline''
%        \item the \TeX{} |\parindent|\footnote{This parameter should
%           perhaps be taken out, there is some discussion related to
%           this elsewhere.}
%      \end{itemize}
% \end{description}
%
% \subsubsection{Line breaking parameters}
%
% Line breaking parameters are considered to be not related to
% individual paragraphs but to paragraphs sequences, i.e., they are
% not reset on each paragraph. Wrong? Instead they are initialized at
% start of galley and are otherwise only settable via templates. One
% could of course make them a multivalued parameter as well.
%
%
%
% \subsubsection{Paragraph-end parameters}
%
% None defined yet (but perhaps should)
%
%
%
% \subsection{Document level (user) commands}
%
% \subsubsection{Penalties}
%
%  To give the user a chance to actually overwrite a penalty setting
%  produced from environments or commands internally updating the
%  galley structure, user level document commands like |\nopagebreak|
%  do not modify the internal \PARM{penalty} but instead use a
%  \PARM{user penalty}. If that parameter is set (i.e., non-empty) it
%  will get used and the internal \PARM{penalty} that is normally
%  applied will be ignored. This way, even in situations where the
%  user request appears too early in the document (e.g., between
%  environments where the following environment would modify
%  \PARM{penalty} the desired outcome is ensured.
%
% \subsubsection{Vertical spaces}
%
% In contrast user commands for specifying vertical space will always
%  add to the existing space.\footnote{Always? i can image to have the
%  desire to explicitly set the space to a fixed value in which case i
%  would like to ensure that the internal value for \PARM{vspace} is
%  fully ignored. On the other hand this may not been sensible because
%   it might be difficult for the user to know how big the space should
%   be.}
%
%
% \subsection{Galley structure after lists/displays}\label{sec:endlist}
%
% After lists or a math display the continuation depends on whether
% the following text logically   is part of the previous material or
% starts a new  paragraph. This difference is coded in the source
% document by leaving or not leaving an empty line (|\par|).
%
% Depending on this the handling of the upcoming paragraph might
% differ in \PARM{penalty}, \PARM{vspace}, \PARM{indent} (and perhaps
% others)
%
% To allow for this a processing mechanism like this should be
% investigated\footnote{There is some concept code for this below but
% it is not finished!}:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item
%   The environment that intends to make use of the structure sets a flag
% \item
%   The values of parameters for the case of the paragraph continuing
%    the previous material are specified by modifying the DGPVs.
% \item
%   The values of parameters for the case that the next paragraph is
%    to be considered independent are specified in a third structure
%    (called XGPV for now) which is a plist like the SGPV (or part of
%    it if we don't allow to modify any odd rubbish in that case,
%    which is probably sensible)
% \item
%    The code for the |\par| command is augmented in a way that if it
%    is executed in vertical mode the following happens:
%    \begin{itemize}
%    \item
%      The values in the XGPV are added to the DGPV values to allow
%      for user level changes to be preserved.
%    \item
%      The flag above is reset so that following |\par| does not
%      modify the DGPV further.
%    \end{itemize}
% \end{itemize}
% The XGPV has to be stored away if a new galley level is initiated!
%
%
%
%
%
% \section{The low-level command interface}
%
% The commands described in this section are used to update the galley
% data structure. Their intended use is a) in kernel code, i.e., in
% parts that are already provided by the \LaTeXplus{} kernel such as
% the basic float mechanism and b) as building blocks for higher-level
% templates such as those defined by the module \texttt{xhj} or the
% module \texttt{xinitials}.
% They are not meant to be used directly when building classes.
%
% Their names are currently very strange and inconsistent and need to
% be normalized.
%
%
%
% \subsection{Manipulating the dynamic galley parameters values}
%
% To manipulate the dynamic parameter values of the galley structure a
% number of commands are available. As explained above changing the
% dynamic parameters effects the only next paragraph (or the next sequence
% of vertical objects between paragraphs) --- afterwards the
% parameters are reset to the values stored in their static counterparts.
%
% \noindent
% \DescribeMacro{\GAL_set_DGPV_thing:nn}\marg{id}\marg{value} \\
% The |\GAL_set_DGPV_thing:nn| command takes a parameter \meta{id} (or more
% exactly its letter or letter sequence such as `j' or `ps') and
% assigns the \meta{value} to it. No processing of the value is
% undertaken.
%
% \noindent
% \DescribeMacro{\GAL_appendto_DGPV_thing:nn}\marg{id}\marg{value} \\
% \DescribeMacro{\GAL_appendto_DGPV_thing:no}
% The |\GAL_appendto_DGPV_thing:nn| also leaves the \meta{value} unchanged
% but appends it to the current value of the parameter. This is, for
% example, used to build the list of whatsits nodes in the \PARM{next
% whatsits} parameter.
%
% \noindent
% \DescribeMacro{\GAL_set_DGPV_dimension:nn}\marg{id}\marg{value} \\
% \DescribeMacro{\GAL_add_DGPV_dimension:nn}
% \DescribeMacro{\GAL_max_DGPV_dimension:nn}
% In contrast the family of |\...DGPVdimension:nn| commands process the
% \meta{value} by interpreting it as a calc dimension expression. The
% result is then set (|\set...|), or added to the current value
% (|\add...|), or compared with the current value (|\max...|) and the
% maximum assigned.
%
% \noindent
% \DescribeMacro{\GAL_set_penalty:n}\marg{value} \\
% \DescribeMacro{\GAL_add_penalty:n}
% What is available for dimensions is also available for integer
% valued parameters. However, since there is only one such parameter
% (the \PARM{penalty}) at the moment, we provide a family of commands
% which take only a \meta{value} argument.
%
% \noindent
% \DescribeMacro{\GAL_set_object:n}\marg{value} \\
% \DescribeMacro{\GAL_set_break:n}
% The |\GAL_set_object:n| and |\GAL_set_break:n| are special variants of
% the |\GAL_set_DGPV_thing:nn| command for the \PARM{object} and
% \PARM{nobreak flag} parameters, respectively.\footnote{should
% probably vanish}
%
% \noindent
% \DescribeMacro{\GAL_set_left_parshape:nnn}\marg{\# of normal lines}
%   \marg{default width} \marg{delta offset list} \\
% \DescribeMacro{\GAL_set_right_parshape:nnn}
% Defines a special parshape (that is it sets the \PARM{parshape}
% taking into account its current setting with respect to the galley
% measure) at the left or the right starting with
% a number of normal lines (first arg) followed by a number of special
% lines which are constructed assuming a hole of a certain width
% (second argument). The number of lines this hole exists vertically is
% defined by the number of delta offsets in the in comma separated
% third argument. The width of each delta is added to the nominal
% width of the hole thus allowing for special corrections on a line by
% line basis.
%
%
%
% \subsection{Manipulating the static galley parameters values}
%
% Manipulating the static galley parameters essentially means changing
% the default values to which these parameters are restored to at the
% end of each paragraph. These commands always set the corresponding
% dynamic parameter as well.
%
% \noindent
% \DescribeMacro{\GAL_set_SGPV_thing:nn} \marg{id} \marg{value}\\
% Like |\GAL_set_DGPV_thing:nn| but for long-term changes, e.g., no
% processing of \meta{value} is undertaken.
%
% \noindent
% \DescribeMacro{\GAL_set_SGPV_dimension:nn} \marg{id} \marg{value} \\
% Like |\GAL_set_DGPV_dimension:nn| but for long-term changes, e.g., the
% \meta{value} is evaluated using calc prior to assigning it to the
% parameter.
%
% There are no commands for making long-term changes to other parts of
% the interface. Mostly because they seemed to be unnecessary. If
% needed they could be added without much problem.
%
%
%
% \subsection{Manipulating the galley measure}
%
% In the current implementation the galley measure, i.e., the width of
% text lines and their indentation from the left are not represented
% by a galley parameter directly. Instead they are internally stored
% as part of the \PARM{parshape} (see discussion above). For
% this reason that parameter can't be (or rather shouldn't be)
% modified directly but only through the commands below and commands
% like |\GAL_set_left_parshape:nnn| which know about those dependencies
% and handle the update accordingly.
%
% \noindent
% \DescribeMacro{\GAL_set_SGPV_measure:nn} \marg{left-margin}
%                                 \marg{line-width} \\
% This command make a long-term change to the measure by setting the
% width of
% the line to \meta{line-width} and the width of the left margin to
% \meta{left-margin}. In addition it sets the registers |\linewidth|
% and |\@totalleftmargin| to these values (for inspection).
%
% \noindent
% \DescribeMacro{\GAL_add_SGPV_measure:nn}
%           \marg{left-margin-increment} \marg{line-width-increment}\\
% This command make a long-term change to the measure by incrementing the
% width of the line with \meta{line-width-increment} and the width
% of the left margin with  \meta{left-margin-increment}. In addition
% it sets the registers |\linewidth|
% and |\@totalleftmargin| to the resulting values (for inspection).
%
%
%
%
%
% \subsection{Saving and restoring SGPV changes}
%
% \DescribeMacro{\GAL_save_galley_state:} \\
% \DescribeMacro{\GAL_restore_galley_state:} This pair of commands stores
% and retrieves the current state of the SGPVs and can be used with
% environments that want to make long term changes and revert to the
% old settings afterwards, i.e. use |\GAL_save_galley_state:| at the
% beginning, before doing any modification, and then
% |\GAL_restore_galley_state:| at the end. They should be called at the
% same level of grouping (as the saving is done locally) and with the
% current implementation they can't be called several times on the
% same level.\footnote{Or so i think; which is something we may not be
% able to leave as that}
%
%
% \subsection{Manipulating the behavior of \texttt{\textbackslash par}}
%
% The |\par| command in \TeX{} is perhaps the most troublesome item of
% the language for the simple reason that it can't be successfully
% trapped by the macro programmer and hidden from (mis)use.
% When \TeX{} sees an empty line it converts it into the token |\par|
% and this name is fixed and can't be changed. It is easy to provide
% special definitions for the action taken when this token is
% processed but there is no way to prevent somebody from overwriting
% those carefully designed interfaces by simply doing something like
% |\let\par\foo|. If this happens anything might go wrong and since
% |\par| is a name that can't be hidden from the user nor from the
% package designer the only thing one can do is to boldly state that
% \begin{center}
%  \bfseries Manual changes to |\par| are not supported!
% \end{center}
%
% Having said this we now present the interfaces that can be used to give
% |\par| a special meaning within \LaTeXplus. It should be stressed
% that |\par| always has a special meaning within the galley mechanism
% and that direct changes to it, at best lead to incorrect formatting,
% far more likely however will lead to disaster.
%
% \noindent
% \DescribeMacro{\GAL_set_normal_par:}\\
% This command defines |\par| to have its standard definition within
% the galley mechanism, i.e., if a paragraph is currently processed it
% will be finished (including all code necessary, e.g., execute end of

%
%
% \section{Open issues}
%
% In this section unresolved issues or ideas to think about and
% perhaps implement are collected. There is no particular order to
% them.
%
% \begin{itemize}
% \item
%   It seems advisable to change the way galleys are set up: don't
%   automatically start a new galley with each vbox but instead start
%   a galley only in dedicated ``galley-boxes'' such as the internal
%   form of |\parbox| etc. The advantage is much less overhead, the
%   disadvantage is that non-conforming packages (written without this
%   mechanism in mind) will 99\% fall over while with the current setup
%   they have a good chance to survive and produce more or less proper
%   formatting.
% \item
%   |\@totalleftmargin| and |\linewidth| need to be adequately dealt
%   with, probably by integrating them properly into the data structure
%   somehow at the parshape level.
% \item
%   It is quite likely that we need more granularity on the interfaces
%   for storing and restoring the galley state. There need to be a
%   full store and restore for cases where an unrelated galley is
%   started in the middle of some other galley (such as formatting a
%   marginal paragraph in the middle of the main galley) but it is not
%   appropriate to store and restore the whole galley state when
%   formatting a list inside a galley (what is wanted there is to
%   store and restore the outer measure, the outer parshape, etc.\ but
%   not any registers which deal with penalties, vertical spaces
%   between paragraphs and so on. So |\GAL_save_galley_state:| needs some
%   companion!
% \item
%   Not properly integrated into the whole scheme are math displays
%   (Michael Downes will hopefully come to rescue me here at some point).
% \end{itemize}
%
%
%
% \StopEventually{}
%
% \section{Implementation}

% Set up certain defaults including to ignore white space
% within the body of this package. \LaTeXe{} release needs to be
% recent because of changing some bits of the |\parbox| handling below.

% \subsection{Tracing}
%
% \begin{macro}{\tracinggalleys}
% \begin{macro}{\GAL_tracinggalleys:}
%    A complicated mechanism like the galley interface needs some
%    tracing facilities. Here we provide some modeled after
%    \TeX's internal low-level tracing functions.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\cs_new_nopar:Npn \tracinggalleys{
  \tex_afterassignment:D\GAL_tracinggalleys:\l_tmpa_int}
%<-trace>\cs_set_eq:NN\GAL_tracinggalleys: \scan_stop:
%    \end{macrocode}
%
%    If we compile this module without tracing than |\tracinggalleys|
%    will scan away an integer assignment but otherwise does
%    nothing. But if we docstrip with tracing included then depending
%    on the integer values the following things happen:
%    \begin{description}
%    \item[0] No tracing.
%    \item[1] All tracing info is written to the log file only.
%    \item[2] All tracing info is written to the terminal.
%    \item[3 and higher] All tracing info is written to the terminal
%      and before it is presented a quick check for other internal
%      \TeX{}-tracing is undertaken. If it looks as if |\tracingall|
%      is currently used then various tracings are temporarily disable
%      to avoid getting the output of the tracing being traced as
%      well. This prevents getting many many uninteresting output
%      lines which would otherwise appear.
%
%      This value can only be used if e\TeX{} in extended mode is used
%      as the formatter, as it sets |\tracingassigns|\footnote{Really
%      useful that primitive, try it one day if you got stuck while
%      macro writing, that alone is worth using e\TeX{} for.} which is
%      not a primitive of \TeX.

% \subsection{Taking away primitives from direct use}
%
% To make this mechanism work we have to shield the primitive \TeX{}
% parameters from direct access by the user or a package writer. We do
% this by giving them internal names of the type
% |\l_GAL_real_|\meta{param-name} and the allocating under the original
% parameter name a suitable register to trap any direct access.
%
% \begin{macro}{\l_GAL_real_club_penalty}
% \begin{macro}{\l_GAL_real_interline_penalty}
% We have to trap |\clubpenalty| and |\interlinepenalty|; both are used

% \subsection{Galley data structure}\label{sec:galley-concept-impl}
%
% \subsubsection{Original concepts}
%
% In earlier implementations of \texttt{galley2.dtx}, galley objects
% have been represented in the following fashion:
%
% \begin{itemize}
% \item the long range values are stored in a within one level in
%   global a plist with the name |\g_GAL_static_hmode_prop| which is a
%   property list keeping all individual galley values for hmode. The
%   keys in the property list are of the form
%   |\GAL@|\meta{letter(s)}|@|.
% \item a copy of this plist is saved away under the name
%   |\GAL@static@hmode@|\meta{level-num}|@plist| just before we start
%   a new level so that when returning to a level the previous state can
%   be reconstructed.\footnote{Instead of doing a global save under a
%    name associated with the level number we could probably simply
%    save the list locally and use the savestack since each new level
%    has to be always associated with a new group anyway!}
% \item the keys in the above plists are also used directly as global
%   variables holding the actual current values of the galley object
%   parameters which allows fast access.
% \item similar plists exists for vmode and perhaps we want even
%   more\footnote{but perhaps not, putting the parameters in different
%   plists is mainly a speed thing, we can use flags to reinit only
%   things that have changed; the lists are shorter which makes
%   property handling faster, etc, but it needs some careful studying
%   at a later stage whether this is really beneficial---in principle
%   there is no problem with keeping all parameters in a single plist.}
% \end{itemize}
% This means that to make a long-term change to some galley object
% parameter one has to change the property within the
% |\GAL@static@|\meta{h/v}|mode@plist|. Such a change is then
% propagated to both the saved version as well as the global key
% commands.
%
% \subsubsection{Current concepts}
%
% After some evaluation I decided to change this setup in favour of
% the following:
%
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Actual values are represented by global token list variables of
%   the form |\g_GAL_|\meta{letter(s)}|_current_tl|.
% \item If they are supposed to be reset after each usage their
%   long-term (static) value is recorded globally in
%   |\g_GAL_|\meta{letter(s)}|_static_tl|.
% \item When starting a new galley level saved versions of the dynamic
%   parameters are stored locally in
%   |\l_GAL_|\meta{letter(s)}|_current_tl| and those for the static
%   parameters are stored in
%   |\l_GAL_|\meta{letter(s)}|_static_tl|. When the level is popped
%   those values are used to restore the state of the parameters. A
%   consequence of this setup is that starting a new galley state
%   should always involve a new group level!
% \end{itemize}
% This means that to make a long-term change to some galley object
% parameter one has to change the
% |\g_GAL_|\meta{letter(s)}|_static_tl| parameter (if it exists) as
% well as the |\g_GAL_|\meta{letter(s)}|_current_tl| one.
%
% If a new parameter is added to this setup we have to modify the
% following functions below: |\GAL_init_static:|,
% |\GAL_save_galley_state:|, \\
% |\GAL_restore_galley_state:|, and
% |\GAL_init_dynamic_fully:|.
%
% \begin{macro}{\GAL_init_static:}
% The |\GAL_init_static:| function initialises the static and dynamic
% parameters with fixed defaults. This is, for example, used when
% starting a new level. At a later state one probably want to be able
% to globally set even those defaults for a whole document, but for
% now this is probably okay.

%  \subsection{Support for paragraph shapes}
%
%
%
%
%
% \begin{macro}{\GAL_parshape_setup:nnnnnn}
%    The |\GAL_parshape_setup:nnnnnn| macro provides a low-level interface for
%    declaring special parshapes for the upcoming paragraph. It is
%    especially tuned to deal with the more common cases like
%    providing space for an initial or for an inline figure. It takes
%    six arguments with the following meaning:
%    \begin{itemize}
%    \item If a hole is to be cut on the left of the paragraph the
%      first argument should be
%      |{\dim_use:N\l_GAL_parshape_lineindent_dim}| otherwise
%      |\@totalleftmargin| (hole on the right). At the moment there is
%      no provision for special shapes on both sides of the
%      paragraph.\footnote{This is low-level but still more than
%        awkward so probably should be replaced by something nicer one
%        day.}
%    \item
%    The second argument gives the indentation to be used for all
%    lines following the last special line. Typical value would be
%    |\@totalleftmargin|, or in case of setting up hanging paragraphs,
%    |\@totalleftmargin+<amount of hang>|. More exactly this indentation
%    is assumed to be what is needed if this would have been a normal
%    paragraph. It is therefore also added to the special lines.
%    \item
%    The third argument gives the line width for all lines following
%    the last special line. Typical argument might be |\linewidth| or
%    in case of hanging paragraphs
%      |\linewidth+<amount of hang>|.\footnote{rewrite
%      description of this and previous item}
%    \item
%    The forth argument gives the number of lines before the first special
%    line (in case of an initial this would be 0 typically).
%    \item
%    The fifth argument gives an initial amount to be left free on all
%    special lines.
%    \item
%    Finally the sixth argument specifies the special lines as a comma
%    separated lists of dimensions. These dimensions are deltas to the
%    space specified in the forth argument.
%    \end{itemize}
%
%    Running this command has several effects:
%    \begin{itemize}
%    \item The |\g_GAL_ps_current_tl| parameter is getting updated,
%      ie it receives the area parshape spec.
%    \item In the |dim| register
%      |\l_GAL_parshape_firstline_indent_dim|, the indent of the first
%      special line (not taking into account the standard line
%      indentation) is made available for use by an application. This
%      can be used to get to the left point on the line to insert an
%      initial character or a figure.

%  \subsubsection{Dimensions (skips and dimens)}
%
%
%  For setting galley parameters of type skip or dimen we provide

%  change, e.g., `v' for vertical skip or `i' for indentation and as
%  second argument a dimension (for setting the parameter to this
%  value or adding this value or using the maximum of the old and the
%  new value, etc).\footnote{They currently work using skip registers
%  internally which means that it is up to the programmer to ensure
%  that a dimen parameter gets passed only dimen values without plus
%  or minus parts.}

%  The following functions now modify the SGPV, i.e., modify the
%  values that are used as defaults unless overwritten for an

% \subsubsection{Objects and thingies in general}
