TEST 1: More variation of type with valid arguments
============================================================
LaTeX cmd Warning: Optional and mandatory argument with same delimiter '{'.
(cmd)              
(cmd)              The mandatory argument specified with 'm' has the same delimiter '{' as an earlier optional argument. It will therefore not be possible to omit all the earlier optional arguments when calling this command.
(cmd)              
(cmd)              This may be intentional, but then it might be a mistake.

control sequence to too much text. How can we recover?
My plan is to forget the whole thing and hope for the best.

I've deleted a group-closing symbol because it seems to be
spurious, as in `$x}$'. But perhaps the } is legitimate and
you forgot something else, as in `\hbox{$x}'. In such cases
the way to recover is to insert both the forgotten and the
deleted material, e.g., by typing `I$}'.
