TEST 1: More variation of type with valid arguments
============================================================
LaTeX3 Warning: Since the mandatory argument 'm' has the same delimiter '{' as
(LaTeX3)        a previous optional argument, it will not be possible to omit
(LaTeX3)        all optional arguments when calling this command.

I've deleted a group-closing symbol because it seems to be
spurious, as in `$x}$'. But perhaps the } is legitimate and
you forgot something else, as in `\hbox{$x}'. In such cases
the way to recover is to insert both the forgotten and the
deleted material, e.g., by typing `I$}'.
