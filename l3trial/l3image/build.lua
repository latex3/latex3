-- Build script for LaTeX3 "l3image" files

-- Identify the bundle and module: the module may be empty in the case where
-- there is no subdivision
bundle = "l3trial"
module = "l3image"

-- Location of main directory: use Unix-style path separators
maindir = "../.."

-- Load the common build code: this is the one place that a path needs to be
-- hard-coded
-- As the build system is 'self-contained' there is no module set up here: just
--load the file in a similar way to a TeX \input
