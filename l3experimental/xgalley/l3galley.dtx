% \section{Introduction}
%
% In \LaTeX3 terminology a galley is a rectangular area which receives
% text and other material filling it from top. The vertically extend of
% a galley is normally not restricted: instead certain chunks are taken
% off the top of an already partially filled galley to form columns or
% similar areas on a page. This process is typically asynchronous but
% there are ways to control or change its behaviour.
%
% Examples for galleys are \enquote{the main galley}, where the
% continuous document data gets formatted into  and from which columns
% and pages are constructed, and \enquote{vertical box galleys}, such
% as the body of a minipage environment. The latter galleys are
% typically not split after formatting, though there can be exceptions.
%
% \section{Formatting layers}
%
% The present module is mainly concerned with the formatting of text
% in galleys. The mechanism by which this is achieved uses four
% (somewhat) distinct layers, some of which can be addressed using the
% templates provided here.
%
% \subsection{Layer one: external dimensions}
%
% The bottom layer of the system is the external dimensions of the
% galley. Normally only the horizontal dimension is fixed externally,
% while the vertical (filling) dimension is unspecified. The external
% dimensions are fixed when starting a new galley, and are therefore
% not modifiable within the galley.
%
% There are no templates for setting this layer directly, although the
% external values are influenced by other parts of the system (for
% example when creating minipage environments).
%
% \subsection{Layer two: internal dimensions}
%
% The second layer is the internal dimensions of the galley: the
% \emph{measure} used for paragraph text and the position of the
% paragraph relative to the edges of the galley.
%
% This layer is normally accessed by higher-level templates
% \emph{via} the object type \texttt{measure}. Changes made using
% level two templates will often extend for large parts of a document
% (up to and including the entire document).
%
% \subsection{Layer three: paragraph shape}
%
% The third layer defines the paragraph shape within the measure as
% provided by the second layer. In the absence of any specification
% for that layer the paragraph shape used will be that of a
% rectangular area of the width of the current measure.
%
% There are some restrictions imposed on the shape of a paragraph by the
% underlying \TeX{} mechanisms. For example, cut out sections in
% paragraphs can be specified from the top of the paragraph but not from
% the bottom.
%
% \subsection{Layer four: formatting inside the paragraph}
%
% The forth layer deals with the paragraph formatting aspects such as
% hyphenation and justification within the paragraph (this is sometimes
% referred to as \enquote{\texttt{h\&j}} or \enquote{\texttt{hj}}). This
% layer is somewhat distinct from the galley as such, but is handled in
% the same place as there is, internally, interaction between the different
% layers.
%
% \section{Code interfaces}
%
% \subsection{Galley layers}
%
% \begin{variable}{\l_galley_width_dim}
%   The total width of a galley, set either by the page geometry code
%   for the main vertical galley or when creating an independent galley,
%   such as a minipage.
% \end{variable}
%
% \begin{function}{\galley_level:}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{galley_level:}
%   \end{syntax}
%   Sets up a vertical box to contain a new galley level. The box should
%   include \enquote{wrapper} group (be \enquote{color safe}): this is
%   automatically true for all \LaTeX3 boxes and coffins.
% \end{function}
%
% \subsection{Measure}
%
% \begin{function}
%   {\galley_margins_set_absolute:nn, \galley_margins_set_relative:nn}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{galley_margins_set_absolute:nn} \Arg{left margin} \Arg{right margin}
%     \cs{galley_margins_set_relative:nn} \Arg{left margin} \Arg{right margin}
%   \end{syntax}
%   Sets the width of the measure to have the \meta{left margin} and
%   \meta{right margin} specified by the arguments, both of which are
%   \meta{dimension expressions}. The \texttt{relative} function will adjust
%   the text width within any existing margins, whereas the \texttt{absolute}
%   measure sets the margins based on the edges of the galley only. One or
%   both of the \meta{margins} may be negative, to specify and outdent.
% \end{function}
%
% \subsection{Between paragraphs}
%
% \begin{variable}{\g_galley_previous_par_lines_int}
%   The number of lines in the preceding conceptual paragraph. This may not
%   correspond to the \TeX{} \tn{prevgraf} primitive value as one conceptual
%   paragraph may contain several \TeX{} \tn{par} primitive tokens.
% \end{variable}
%
% \begin{variable}{\g_galley_restore_running_tl}
%   When galley settings need to be reset at the end of a paragraph, the
%   appropriate detail should be added to this token list. It is inserted
%   immediately before the start of each paragraph, and can therefore be
%   used to clear otherwise global settings. The token list itself is
%   also cleared as part of this process.
% \end{variable}
%
% \begin{variable}{\g_galley_no_break_next_bool}
%   Indicates that no page break should be allowed between the current
%   paragraph and the next paragraph.
% \end{variable}
%
% \begin{function}{\g_galley_omit_next_indent_bool}
%   Indicates that the indent should be omitted from the start of the next
%   paragraph started.
% \end{function}
%
% \begin{variable}{\l_galley_interpar_penalty_int}
%   The \meta{penalty} for a break between paragraphs. The \meta{penalty}
%   should be in the range $-10\,000$ to $10\,000$, where $-10\,000$ forces a
%   page break, $0$ has no effect at all and  $10\,000$ forbids a page break.
%   Note that setting \cs{g_galley_no_break_next_bool} to \texttt{true}
%   will override any setting of \cs{l_galley_interpar_penalty_int}.
% \end{variable}
%
% \begin{variable}{\l_galley_interpar_vspace_skip}
%   Stretchable space to be inserted between paragraphs, set at the design
%   or template level.
% \end{variable}
%
% \begin{function}{\galley_penalty_set_single:n}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{galley_penalty_set_single:n} \Arg{penalty}
%     \cs{galley_penalty_add_single:n} \Arg{penalty}
%   \end{syntax}
%   Sets the \meta{penalty} for a break between the current and next
%   paragraph on a one-off basis. This function is intended for user-level
%   adjustments to design, and takes precedent over both settings from
%   \cs{l_galley_interpar_penalty_int} and from \cs{galley_no_break_next:}.
%   The \texttt{add} variant adds the penalty to any existing values.
% \end{function}
%
% \begin{function}
%   {
%     \galley_vspace_set_single:n ,
%     \galley_vspace_add_single:n ,
%     \galley_vspace_max_single:n
%   }
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{galley_vspace_set_single:n} \Arg{space}
%   \end{syntax}
%   Sets the \meta{space} to be inserted between the current and next
%   paragraph on a one-off basis. This function is intended for user-level
%   adjustments to design. The \texttt{add} and \texttt{max} variants add
%   to the existing spacing and set to the maximum of the existing value
%   and the argument, respectively.
% \end{function}
%
% \subsection{Paragraph shape}
%
% \begin{function}
%   {
%     \galley_parshape_set_multi:nnnN,
%     \galley_parshape_set_multi:nVVN,
%     \galley_parshape_set_single:nnnN,
%     \galley_parshape_set_single:nVVN
%   }
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{galley_parshape_set_multi:nnnN} \Arg{unaltered lines} \Arg{left indents} \Arg{right indents} \meta{resume flag}
%     \cs{galley_parshape_set_single:nnnN} \Arg{unaltered lines} \Arg{left indents} \Arg{right indents} \meta{resume flag}
%   \end{syntax}
%   Sets the current paragraph shape to create an arbitrary paragraph shape.
%   The paragraph shape is set such that there are \meta{unaltered lines} which
%   have width and indent as set by the measure. The \enquote{altered} lines
%   are then defined by the comma-separated lists of \meta{left indents} and
%   \meta{right indents}. These are both indents from the edge of the measure,
%   and may be negative, and should both contain the same number of items.
%   If the \meta{resume flag} is \texttt{true}, after the last
%   altered line the paragraph shape returns to that of the measure. On the
%   other hand, if the flag is \texttt{false} then the shape of the last line
%   is retained for the rest of the paragraph.
%   For example,
%   \begin{verbatim}
%     \galley_parshape_set_multi:nnnN { 1 }
%       { 2 pt , 4 pt , 6 pt } { 2 pt , 4 pt , 6 pt } \c_true_bool
%   \end{verbatim}
%   would create a paragraph shape in which the first line is the full
%   width of the measure, the second line is indented by $2$\,pt on each side,
%   the third line by $4$\,pt and the fourth line and subsequent lines by
%   $6$\,pt from the edge of the measure on each side.
%
%   The \texttt{single} version applies only to a single paragraph,
%   while the \texttt{multi} function sets the paragraph shape on an
%   ongoing basis within the scope of the current \TeX{} group.
% \end{function}
%
% \begin{function}
%   {
%     \galley_cutout_left:nn,
%     \galley_cutout_right:nn
%   }
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{galley_cutout_left:nn} \Arg{unaltered lines} \Arg{indents}
%     \cs{galley_cutout_right:nn} \Arg{unaltered lines} \Arg{indents}
%   \end{syntax}
%   Adds a cutout section to the active paragraph shape, leaving
%   \meta{unaltered lines} unchanged and then applying the \meta{indents}
%   (a comma list). The cutout will be placed on the left or right as indicated
%   by the function name, and will apply to exactly the number of lines
%   specified (the total of the \meta{unaltered lines} and the number of
%   entries in the \meta{indents} list). Several cutouts may be applied
%   sequentially: these act in an additive sense.
% \end{function}
%
% \subsection{Formatting inside the paragraph}
%
% The settings described here apply \enquote{inside} the paragraph, and so
% are active irrespective of any paragraph shape within the measure.
%
% \begin{variable}{\l_galley_line_left_skip, \l_galley_line_right_skip}
%   Stretchable space added to the appropriate side each line in a paragraph.
% \end{variable}
%
% \begin{variable}{\l_galley_par_begin_skip, \l_galley_par_end_skip}
%   Stretchable space added to the beginning of the first line and end of
%   the last line of a paragraph, respectively.
% \end{variable}
%
% \begin{variable}{\l_galley_par_indent_dim}
%   Fixed space added to the start of each paragraph except for those where
%   \cs{g_galley_omit_next_indent_bool} is \texttt{true}.
% \end{variable}
%
% \begin{variable}{\l_galley_last_line_fit_int}
%   Determines how the inter-word stretch is set for the last line of a
%   paragraph when
%   \begin{enumerate}
%     \item the value of \cs{l_galley_par_end_skip} contains an infinite
%       (\texttt{fil(l)}) component;
%     \item the values of \cs{l_galley_line_left_skip} and
%       \cs{l_galley_line_right_skip} do \emph{not} contain an infinite
%       (\texttt{fil(l)}) component.
%   \end{enumerate}
%   Under these circumstances, \cs{l_galley_last_line_fit_int} is active, and
%   applies as follows:
%   \begin{itemize}
%     \item when set to~$0$, the last line of the paragraph is set with
%       the inter-word spacing at natural width;
%    \item when set to a $1000$ (or above), the inter-word spacing in the last
%      line is stretched by the same factor as that applied to the penultimate
%      line;
%    \item when set to~$n$ between these extremes, the inter-word spacing in
%      the last line is stretched by $n/1000$ times the factor used for the
%      penultimate line.
%   \end{itemize}
% \end{variable}
%
% \begin{function}{\galley_interword_spacing_set:N}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{galley_interword_spacing_set:N} \meta{fixed spacing bool}
%   \end{syntax}
%   Sets the inter-word spacing used based on the values supplied by the
%   current font. If the \meta{fixed spacing bool} flag is \texttt{true} then
%   no stretch is permitted between words, otherwise the stretch specified by
%   the font designer is used.
% \end{function}
%
% \subsection{Display material}
%
% Material which is set in \enquote{display-style} require additional settings
% to control the relationship with the surrounding material.
%
% \begin{function}{\galley_display_begin:, \galley_display_end:}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{galley_display_begin:}
%       \ldots
%     \cs{galley_display_end:}
%   \end{syntax}
%   Sets up a group to contain display-style material. Unlike an independent
%   galley level, settings are inherited from the surroundings. However,
%   the interaction of a display block with the paragraphs before and after it
%   can be adjusted independent of the design of text.
% \end{function}
%
% \subsection{Hyphenation}
%
% \begin{variable}{\l_galley_hyphen_left_int}
%   THIS IS A HACK: SEE CODE!
% \end{variable}
%
% \subsection{Line breaking}
%
% \begin{variable}{\l_galley_binop_penalty_int}
%   Penalty charged if an inline math formula is broken at a
%   binary operator.
% \end{variable}
%
% \begin{variable}{\l_galley_double_hyphen_demerits_int}
%   Extra demerit charge of two (or more) lines in succession end
%   in a hyphen.
% \end{variable}
%
% \begin{variable}{\l_galley_emergency_stretch_skip}
%   Additional stretch assumed for each line if no better line breaking
%   can be found without it. This stretch is not actually added to lines,
%   so its use may result in underfull box warnings.
% \end{variable}
%
% \begin{variable}{\l_galley_final_hyphen_demerits_int}
%   Extra demerit charge if the second last line is hyphenated.
% \end{variable}
%
% \begin{variable}{\l_galley_linebreak_badness_int}
%   Boundary that if exceeded will cause \TeX{} to report an
%   underfull line.
% \end{variable}
%
% \begin{variable}{\l_galley_linebreak_fuzz_dim}
%   Boundary below which overfull lines are not reported.
% \end{variable}
%
% \begin{variable}{\l_galley_linebreak_penalty_int}
%   Extra penalty charged per line in the paragraph. By making
%   this penalty higher \TeX{} will try harder to produce compact
%   paragraphs.
% \end{variable}
%
% \begin{variable}{\l_galley_linebreak_pretolerance_int}
%   Maximum tolerance allowed for individual lines to break the
%   paragraph without attempting hyphenation.
% \end{variable}
%
% \begin{variable}{\l_galley_linebreak_tolerance_int}
%   Maximum tolerance allowed for individual lines when breaking a
%   paragraph while attempting hyphenation (if this limit can't be
%   met \cs{l_galley_emergency_stretch_skip} comes into play).
% \end{variable}
%
% \begin{variable}{\l_galley_mismatch_demerits_int}
%   Extra demerit charge if two visually incompatible lines follow
%   each other.
% \end{variable}
%
% \begin{variable}{\l_galley_relation_penalty_int}
%   Penalty charged if an inline math formula is broken at a
%   relational symbol.
% \end{variable}
%
% \begin{function}{\galley_break_line:Nn}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{galley_break_line:Nn} \meta{boolean} \Arg{dimexpr}
%   \end{syntax}
%   Breaks the current line, filling the remaining space with \texttt{fil}
%   glue. If the \meta{boolean} is \texttt{true} then a page break is possible
%   after the broken line. Vertical space as given by the \meta{dimexpr} will
%   be inserted between the broken line and the next line.
% \end{function}
%
% \subsection{Paragraph breaking}
%
% \begin{variable}{\l_galley_parbreak_badness_int}
%   Boundary that if exceeded will cause \TeX{} to report an
%   underfull vertical box.
% \end{variable}
%
% \begin{variable}{\l_galley_parbreak_fuzz_dim}
%   Boundary below which overfull vertical boxes are not reported.
% \end{variable}

%   \end{syntax}
%   Set the penalties for breaking lines at the beginning and end of
%   (partial) paragraphs. In each case, the \meta{penalty list} is a
%   comma-separated list of penalty values. The list applies as follows:

%       math environment.
%     \item[\texttt{widow}] Penalties for breaking before the last,
%       penultimate, antepenultimate, etc.~line of the paragraph.
%   \end{itemize}
%   In all cases, these penalties apply in addition to the general interline
%   penalty or to any \enquote{special} line penalties.
% \end{function}
%
% \begin{function}{\galley_interline_penalty_set:n}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{galley_interline_penalty_set:n} \Arg{penalty}

%   Sets the standard interline penalty applied between lines of a paragraph.
%   This value is added to any (display) club or widow penalty in force.

%   Expands to the current interline penalty as a \meta{integer denotation}.
% \end{function}
%
% \section{Hooks and insertion points}
%
% \begin{variable}{\g_galley_par_begin_hook_tl}
%   Token list inserted at the beginning of every paragraph in horizontal mode.
%   This is inserted after any paragraph indent but before any other horizontal
%   mode material.
% \end{variable}
%
% \begin{variable}{\g_galley_par_end_hook_tl}
%   Token list inserted at the end of every paragraph in horizontal mode.
% \end{variable}
%
% \begin{variable}{\g_galley_par_reset_hook_tl}
%   Token list inserted after each paragraph. This is used for resetting
%   galley parameters, and is therefore cleared after use. It is inserted
%   in vertical mode and must not contain horizontal mode material.
% \end{variable}
%
% \begin{variable}{\g_galley_whatsit_next_tl}

%
% \section{Paragraphs}
%
% \begin{function}{\galley_par:}

%
% \begin{function}{\galley_par:n}

%   needs to add tokens to the preceding paragraph.
% \end{function}
%
% \section{Information variables}
%
% Some of the variables for the galley mechanism may be of
% interest to the programmer. These should all be treated as read-only

% \begin{implementation}
%
% \section{\pkg{l3galley} implementation}
%
% At the implementation level, there are a number of challenges which
% have to be overcome in order to make the galley easy to use at the
% designer and user levels. Inserting material into the main vertical
% list is in many ways an irreversible operation. Inserting items as
% they appear in the source is therefore not desirable. Instead,
% inserting vertical-mode material needs to be delayed until the start
% of the \enquote{next} paragraph. This is particularly notable for
% invisible items such as whatsits and specials, which will otherwise
% cause changes in spacing. Delaying insertion enables user-supplied
% settings to override design settings in a reliable fashion. This can
% be achieved as the design-level material can be ignored if a user
% value is supplied. There is a need to allow proper nesting of
% galleys, which means that all of the above needs to be set up so that
% it can be saved and restored. All of these manipulations require
% altering the meaning of the \cs{par} token, which is particularly
% awkward as \TeX{} inserts a token \emph{called} \cs{par} rather than
% one with a particular meaning. This makes moving \cs{par} to somewhere
% \enquote{safe} extremely challenging.
%
% Added to all of this complexity, there is a need to deal with
% \enquote{display-like} material. The most obvious example is the way
% lists are handled. These use \cs{par} tokens to achieve the correct
% appearance, but at the same time
% \begin{verbatim}
%   Text
%   \begin{itemize}
%     \item An item
%   \end{itemize}
%   More text
% \end{verbatim}
% should form one visual paragraph while
% \begin{verbatim}
%   Text
%   \begin{itemize}
%     \item An item
%   \end{itemize}
%
%   More text
% \end{verbatim}
% should be shown as two paragraphs. This requires an additional level
% of handling so that the \cs{par} token used to end the list in the
% first case does not start a new paragraph in a visual sense while the
% second does.
%
% Another factor to bear in mind is that \cs{tex_everypar:D} may be
% executed inside a group. For example, a paragraph starting
% \begin{verbatim}
%   {Text} here
% \end{verbatim}
% will insert the tokens such that the current group level is $1$
% higher for \enquote{Text} than for \enquote{here}. The result of this
% is that it's very important to watch how flags are set and reset. This
% can only be done reliably on a global level, which then has a knock-on
% effect on the rest of the implementation.
%
% At a \TeX{} level, settings can only apply to the current paragraph,
% but conceptually there is a need to allow for both single-paragraph
% and \enquote{running} settings. Whenever the code switches galley
% level both of these need to be correctly saved.

%
% \begin{variable}{\g_@@_begin_level_bool, \l_@@_begin_level_bool}

%    \begin{macrocode}
\bool_new:N \g_@@_begin_level_bool
\bool_new:N \l_@@_begin_level_bool

%   }
%   To apply cutouts across paragraphs, they need to be tracked. The
%   information has to be global, so is handled here.

% \end{variable}
%
% \begin{variable}
%   {\g_galley_omit_next_indent_bool, \l_@@_omit_next_indent_bool}
%   A global flag is needed for suppressing indentation of the next
%   paragraph. This does not need a \enquote{running} version since that
%   should be handled using the \texttt{justification} object: the two
%   concepts are related but not identical. The flag here is needed in
%   cases such as the very first paragraph in a galley or immediately
%   following a heading.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\bool_new:N \g_galley_omit_next_indent_bool
\bool_new:N \l_@@_omit_next_indent_bool
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{variable}
%
% \begin{variable}{\g_galley_no_break_next_bool, \l_@@_no_break_next_bool}
%   Dealing with the no-break flag is pretty much the same as the case

%   }
%   Hooks for user-level code: these are not used by the galley itself.

%
% \begin{variable}
%   {\g_galley_par_reset_hook_tl, \l_@@_par_reset_hook_tl}
%   This one is used by the galley: it happens \enquote{after} the current

%    \begin{macrocode}

%   }
%   The number of lines in the previous typeset paragraph. This is reset at
%   the start of the paragraph and \emph{added to} when each \cs{tex_par:D}
%   primitive is used: \LaTeX{} uses the primitive in places that do not end
%   a (conceptual) paragraph. There is also a set of variables to deal with
%   the current (conceptual) paragraph, so that the information can be
%   build up correctly.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\int_new:N \g_galley_previous_par_lines_int

%
% \begin{variable}{\g_galley_restore_running_tl, \l_@@_restore_running_tl}
%   When a parameter is altered from the \enquote{running} value to a
%   different \enquote{current} one, there needs to be a method to restore
%   the \enquote{running} value. This is done by adding the necessary
%   assignment to a token list, which can be executed when needed. At the
%   same time, this information is itself part of the galley parameter
%   structure, and so there has to be a local save version.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\tl_new:N \g_galley_restore_running_tl
\tl_new:N \l_@@_restore_running_tl

%   }
%   Whatsits only apply on a per-paragraph basis and so there is no need
%   to differentiate between current and running values. However, there
%   is a need to differentiate between whatsits that attach to the
%   previous (completed) paragraph and those that attach to the next

% \subsection{Independent galley levels}
%
% As well as the main vertical list, independent galleys are required
% for items such as minipages and marginal notes. Each of these galleys
% requires an independent set of global data structures. This is
% achieved by storing the data structures in \emph{local} variables. The
% later are only used to save and restore the global value, and so \TeX{}
% grouping will manage the values correctly. This implies that each
% galley level must form a group: galley levels are tied to vertical
% boxes and so this is a reasonable requirements.
%
% \begin{variable}{\l_@@_group_level_int}
%   The top group level for the galley needs to be known to allow
%   some data structures to be reset correctly: they can only be

%   No marker, so really insert a paragraph: the \cs{tex_par:D} is inside a

%   Once a cutout has been set, properly tidying up needs some work. The
%   cutout is applied \enquote{just in time} at the start of each paragraph
%   (see above). After the paragraph, the consumed lines are removed from
%   the tracking sequences and the paragraph shape is reset. The latter step
%   is required as we do not set the paragraph shape for every paragraph.
%   Once the two sequences are empty, there is no cutout to apply. However,
%   it can still be \enquote{active}. If a cutout is started then we have a
%   group, it is possible for the cutout to be entirely applied before the
%   end of the group. At that point, the two sequences show there is nothing
%   to do \emph{but} the active paragraph shape still has some lines indented.
%   As we avoid setting the \tn{parshape} primitive for every paragraph,
%   the result of only checking the sequences would be that the cutout would
%   reappear after the group! Instead, we use a boolean and only set it
%   false once the group level is that of the galley itself. (There is a slight
%   inefficiency here in that we thus do set the paragraph shape for each
%   paragraph after a cutout until we reach the top group level of the galley.
%   That should be an acceptable hit given the extra work needed to track
%   reset-in-this-group as well.)

%   The method used here is to assume that the next piece of horizontal

%   The \enquote{special} meaning of the paragraph token starts by putting

%   blank line. Thus the next piece of material is a separate conceptual
%   paragraph from the display. In that case, the assumption from above is
%   undone and the indent is turned back on. On the other hand, for the
%   case where \TeX{} is in horizontal mode then a \cs{tex_par:D} primitive
%   is required in the same way as in \cs{galley_standard_par:}. Most of
%   the settings for a conceptual paragraph will carry over there but any

% \subsection{Insertions using \cs{tex_everypar:D}}

% is moved out of the way, with appropriate hooks left attached for
% further modification by other modules and by the user. This is all
% done such that there is no danger of accidentally deactivating the
% galley mechanism.
%
% \begin{macro}{\everypar}
%   When used on top of \LaTeXe{} the original primitive name needs to be
%   available without the risk of completely overwriting the new
%   mechanism. This is implemented as a token register in case low-level
%   \TeX{} is used. The \TeX{} primitive is set here as otherwise the
%   \LaTeXe{} \cs{@nodocument} is never removed from the register.
%   This precaution is not be needed for a stand-alone format.

%
% \begin{variable}{\g_@@_last_box}
%   A temporary box to hold the box inserted by \TeX{} when a paragraph

%   (i.e., \cs{tex_parindent:D} is globally zero), but there is
%   still an empty box to test for.

%
% The \enquote{start of paragraph} routines are fired by \cs{tex_everypar:D}.

% and so anything applied here must be done globally.

% \begin{macro}{\@@_start_paragraph_common:N}

%   The routine at the start of a paragraph starts by removing any

%   get back into vertical mode before they are tidied up. To get back
%   again to horizontal mode, \cs{tex_noindent:D} can be used. To avoid

% Cutouts are another way of looking at paragraph shapes, but apply to
% a fixed number of lines within a galley. As such, they require separate
% handling from the measure and shape.
%

% \begin{macro}{\@@_cutout:nnn}
% \begin{macro}{\@@_cutout:NN, \@@_cutout:cN, \@@_cutout:Nc}
%   Setting up cutouts on the two sides of the paragraph is more or less
%   the same idea with one or two very specific points of difference. As such,
%   the two interface functions both use the same implementation.
%    \begin{macrocode}

\cs_new_protected:Npn \galley_cutout_right:nn
  { \@@_cutout:nnn { right } }
%    \end{macrocode}
%   The cutout information needs to be saved in the appropriate sequence.
%   First, the input is converted to a (temporary) sequence. If there is
%   no existing cutout defined, this is simply stored. On the other hand,
%   if there is a cutout already active, the new one needs to be added to
%   it. To achieve that, we iterate over whichever sequence is longer
%   (so that every relevant line is covered). At the end of this process,
%   the paragraph shape needs to be activated. Notice here that we use
%   a global temporary sequence: this allows the auxiliary \cs{@@_cutout:NN}
%   to apply \cs{seq_gpop_left:NNF } with whichever sequence is shorter.
%   The parshape is not set at this stage as cutouts need handling
%   on a per-paragraph level.

% \begin{macro}{\@@_parshape_set_cutouts:N}
%   The real paragraph shape (\cs{tex_parshape:D}) is set whenever any
%   of the conceptual elements (margins, measure, cutouts) are set and
%   potentially at the end of a paragraph in the cases where a single-paragraph
%   measure or a cutout was active. Rather than try to track different
%   combinations of the elements, as was done in earlier versions of this
%   code, the approach taken here is always to reset the entire shape. This
%   is done in three stages, one for each conceptual element.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\cs_new_protected:Npn \@@_parshape_set:
  {
    \@@_parshape_set_margins:
    \@@_parshape_set_indents:
    \@@_parshape_set_cutouts:
  }
%    \end{macrocode}
%   Setting the margins is simple. Either they are zero, using the full measure,
%   or they are not. This is always set even if there are other elements to
%   apply as these settings are very fast, so it is not worth doing a check
%   at this stage for further parts to apply.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\cs_new_protected:Npn \@@_parshape_set_margins:
  {
    \bool_lazy_and:nnTF
      { \dim_compare_p:nNn \l_galley_total_left_margin_dim  = \c_zero_dim }

          \l_galley_text_width_dim
      }
  }
%    \end{macrocode}
%   If there is a measure (indent) to apply this simply overwrites the
%   settings for the margins. As there are two sequences to use it is
%   convenient to use a thread mapping, which means that the shorter sequence
%   will always apply. The margins are reapplied at this stage as part of
%   the auxiliary for the calculation of indentation.

%   Calculating cutouts is by far the most complex operation here. The
%   first step is to establish if this needs to be done at all. If so,
%   the cutout list and the matching measure (indent) are stored in two
%   temporary sequences so that they can safely be \enquote{chomped} by
%   \cs{@@_cutout:NN}. We then construct the overall list of indents required
%   and store them in dedicated temporary storage. That is necessary as to get
%   the indents correct on both sides is to use a thread mapping. That also
%   means that the two sequences need to be of the same length.  That is
%   done by finding the length difference then applying an auxiliary to
%   the shorter sequence.

%    \end{macrocode}
%   To work out the offsets for a cutout, we first check that there is

%   will resume after the cutout. That is done in a global temporary sequence,

% \subsection{Inter-word spacing}
%
% Setting the spacing between words and between sentences is important
% for achieving the correct output from ragged and centered output. At
% the same time, as far as possible the aim is to retain the spacing
% specified by the font designer and not to use arbitrary values
% (\emph{cf.}~the approach in \emph{The \TeX{}book}, p.~101).
%
% \begin{macro}{\galley_interword_spacing_set:N}
%   The approach taken to setting a fixed space is to use the information
%   from the current font to set the spacing. This means that only
%   \cs{tex_spacefactor:D} needs to be set, while \cs{tex_xspacefactor:D}
%   is left alone. However, this is only necessary for fonts which have
%   a stretch component to the inter-word spacing in the first place,
%   i.e., monospaced fonts require no changes. The code therefore
%   checks whether there is any stretch, and if there is uses the fixed
%   component to set \cs{tex_spaceskip:D}. If there is a stretch component
%   (non-zero \cs{tex_fontdimen:D} \texttt{3}), then the \cs{teX_spaceskip:D}
%   is set to the fixed component from the font.
